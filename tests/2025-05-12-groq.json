                "The speaker discusses the musical Dear Evan Hansen and its recent film adaptation. They analyze what went wrong with the movie and how it failed to translate the stage show to the screen. The speaker also touches on the trend of musical adaptations and the challenges of bringing Broadway shows to the big screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has several issues, including poor casting choices, particularly with Ben Platt playing Evan Hansen at an age that doesn't align with the character's high school age.",
                "The film also struggles with translating the stage production to screen, making it hard to empathize with Evan's character. The music in the film is also criticized, with added songs feeling shoehorned and generic. The adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen for film has several issues, primarily with the cutting of certain songs and changes to the script. The speaker argues that these changes, such as cutting the song 'Does Anybody Have a Map?'",
                "and replacing 'Good For You' with a two-minute argument scene, detract from the story and characters. The film's attempts to address criticisms of the stage show, like making Evan admit to lying on social media, fall flat. The speaker also criticizes the film's direction and cinematography, saying they don't effectively translate the stage show to screen. The speaker discusses the difficulties of adapting stage musicals to film, using Dear Evan Hansen and The Last Five Years as examples.",
                "They highlight the differences between the two mediums, particularly in terms of how time and space are conveyed, and how musical numbers are staged and shot. The speaker argues that the film adaptations of these musicals often struggle to translate the unique qualities of the stage productions to the screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has been criticized for its awkward and uncomfortable musical numbers, poor directing, and drastic tonal shift from the stage show. The movie's attempts to ground the story in realism come across as forced and unnatural, leading to a dull and depressing viewing experience.",
                "The speaker argues that the film's problems are not unique to Dear Evan Hansen, but rather a symptom of a larger issue with musical film adaptations. The speaker discusses their love for musicals, specifically highlighting Stephen Sondheim's works, and analyzes the current state of movie musicals, citing the box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and In the Heights. They express concern that film adaptations often lack the essence of what makes musicals great, such as strong choreography and emotionally explosive numbers. The speaker also promotes their content on Nebula and CuriosityStream."

                "This video is brought to you by CuriosityStream. Get access to CuriosityStream and my streaming service Nebula and watch my Nebula exclusive video, Debater Theater at curiositystream.com slash sarahz. Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video, um, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that you're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just giving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a breaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly producing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right?",
                "Um, on a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it? So you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking on this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good. Not only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was also just a pretty bad film in its own right. And all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels that have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie.",
                "Though out of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is titled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite. But Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been in the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably hearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film adaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting to come to fruition. Both casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that of Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with lots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters start their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even if they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role and just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen.",
                "Dear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously bad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to play a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually just looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps happening.",
                "We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these embarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations that are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly muted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have you. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just… fascinating.",
                "And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking about adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear Evan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the translation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals in general.",
                "So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal? So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015. When the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously thinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it. You know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up, and Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway.",
                "And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who did do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight. So, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be referenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer. I saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything.",
                "Evan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins, which is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc. He struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real friends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house, her family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity, and he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles, and prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor.",
                "Evan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter on him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their four best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong- armed and interrupted the first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along with the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along He gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him as a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes viral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died. We also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is extremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also either suicidal or just mentally ill in general,",
                "and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to hide that fact.",
                "In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's family is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up confessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts to repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year later, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and the two of them reflect on all of what happened. The musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number of changes made from the final edition.",
                "There was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts and apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut. You can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff like the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call. It was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna be in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same throughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows. One notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of Alana who went through a different actor at every reading.",
                "They were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who they wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines through most performances and adaptations of the show. When they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the project. It's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview period- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really wasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead of just dropping the show is extremely funny, though.",
                "According to Justin Paul, one of the three people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot take Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they finally had a finished show. And this thing was a huge fucking hit.",
                "Dear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety of different reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show, its representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships between all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen and his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people felt that it was able to create. Not only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had the musical up against a number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them, also including Best Musical.",
                "Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the show later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all of these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog Day I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of tickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept. But Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically impressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the very least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten.",
                "And while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award success and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social media platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise of shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy, or to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only get that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have been friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well, what if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together?",
                "So you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen, or just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success and popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had. This has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather got, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community as of late.",
                "Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head, I can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their primary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and they tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway. Nowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's, which ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following in two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for so much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning Thief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers and popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness.",
                "Shows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly to a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too. This divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever, but usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act politely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like, existing in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them. That critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are, while not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens.",
                "Shows like Mean Girls or Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex, relatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a limited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right now and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible tends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation for such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good.",
                "So as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans who only like teen musicals thing. That being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter, and the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not liking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical would get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action Beauty and the Beast.",
                "Another thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced and started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people would hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume it's a coming out story about a gay kid. I did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this. So when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia page for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family whose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter and also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what the fuck?",
                "So there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is a musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible and bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show handles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal with how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately by the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed.",
                "Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had a lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like The Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was actually about.",
                "And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures of Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school student, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse. So you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question of like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source material poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like, its source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material, and the other is a failure to adapt it correctly.",
                "So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good? Both in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about mental health. Eh. It was fine.",
                "Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor you see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts grief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done, there are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story. Especially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom.",
                "It manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms trying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him, we are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection with his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan with a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son while having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like, social media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come with a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less as their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity.",
                "There's a lot to like about this show, and I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window, connected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times, and every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me reconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that. But it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show.",
                "There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of the songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important character of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature, but songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good. The show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in their full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it first came out was its depiction of social media.",
                "Because like, yeah, we do see that a little. Evan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube. My speech? People started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere.",
                "Your speech is everywhere. This morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it. How many does it have now? 4,580.",
                "16,239! He is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and the less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the less likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how we're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment of yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of abusive comments and phone calls online.",
                "So it's definitely a present theme in the show, but it's very much only explored on a surface level. We don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean on it sometimes and going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising money, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows him to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared to in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way.",
                "There are weird little mental health nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off his meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words, he doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it. And I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad things, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more kind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it.",
                "But it does at times struggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense. One of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful, and having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love, and Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't really talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good than bad, which is an interesting message.",
                "I don't… really agree with this point about punishment. Mostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see evildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want? He loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part of that family anymore. Do you want him to go to child jail too What?",
                "But at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much beaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately. But at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications for others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because of something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible good that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again, there's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can do to a person, and they just don't.",
                "And finally, there's the fact that, for all the show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and whatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really more a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story centering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his life are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques is the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by others, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to.",
                "But I think the message is weakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor, or to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end up being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly uncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself. And then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work. Alana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing the lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be a suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan.",
                "A depressed girl who, instead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending on how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which is largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike Evan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations besides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between either a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles. It's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that Alana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really work.",
                "And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show, be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is really… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love it, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either hate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely mid-tier show.",
                "One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths, but at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future version of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of those aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut out the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked.",
                "And actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out stuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work. So like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is bad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from an adaptational standpoint.",
                "Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in general. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's to be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible from the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film is always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie musicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original. But then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen.",
                "And there's just so much here that's just really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie. Very much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting, and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild. I will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and that is the fact that James Corden is not in it.",
                "Other than that, there's a lot to look at here. So Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film back in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation. He originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician like a year prior.",
                "His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be Ben Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at this point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look old. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late twenties.",
                "Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly look like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from watching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much younger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter.",
                "Also, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer eraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak. But the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually fucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage, and makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how exactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up getting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something.",
                "Evan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally not as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on stage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done and as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid.",
                "He's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt on camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are watching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable to us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance section feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought him this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that we're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music.",
                "And the thing is, this is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's Broadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors in their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your casting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is. is. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening on stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story. So this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social media posts will pop up throughout the show.",
                "This is obviously like a metaphorical representation of social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience, convey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its faults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage. The way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt, isn't literal.",
                "There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things will act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a representation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much. Half the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more complicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space of Matilda.",
                "Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't just fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and costumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like a literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role, it's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping into the space.",
                "The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best best most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a movie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more literal representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look really fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close, and in a much more grounded and realistic setting.",
                "So when you're making a movie, whether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a lot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever you're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active effort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls apart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit, if your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious.",
                "Meryl Streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods, which is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the the more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed back into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action film just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the film with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like very… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags under her eyes.",
                "She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a fetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and she would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout every scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well, the differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context of its realism. In terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine. There were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super in depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor playing that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women.",
                "But other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their job. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the unfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still hinges on Evan.",
                "Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone else. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this show comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled into the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the story because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen looks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way that we could on stage. But even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still can't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go beyond just who is acting in it.",
                "Another really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music, And the film unfortunately fucks this up too. So something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted to film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen. You are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going to be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical. So for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're the wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations like Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful Ghosts from the Cats movie.",
                "And generally speaking, this is just something you're going to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always bad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies' Choice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more of a chance to sing.",
                "But these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical. Part of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the films is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song. Which you know is fine. If they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure.",
                "But it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were these deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like, come on. We all know that that is absolutely never the real reason. It sucks. But it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward places in the story, and two, the songs being very generic.",
                "That was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of the context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the time when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original music, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later.",
                "But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with Alana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the original show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the only one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we don't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out in the film's favour.",
                "Unfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental health, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea that lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering in this way.",
                "In terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where we didn't see much of it in the show. So in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg plays Alana. I'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was how they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because it's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film. I'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including ones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the most dour, depressing way possible.",
                "Everyone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental health, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very depressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film. He thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. He did?",
                "He thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. But Alana as a character especially suffers from this. In the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira.",
                "So what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs and achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness. Hey, how was your summer? Mine was productive. I did three internships and 90 hours of community service.",
                "The idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone like Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable. But the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks to Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really.",
                "You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications. Well, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June.",
                "We were in school in June. So for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes, hey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad a lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who delivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life and her own struggles because that was missing in the original show.",
                "And we do have one of those rare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap in the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story and or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that were removed in the film.",
                "This is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top of being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend to be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less without the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth. So when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes, certain songs are just going to have to get cut.",
                "Or sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they do in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably never should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could have pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning isn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty.",
                "But these things don't just affect the cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs that having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally speaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when a song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it being you sing when you can no longer speak.",
                "These tend to be points of heightened emotion that are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader story. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because it sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about with one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about their complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these characters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue.",
                "The song is really important, and it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate that movie. I hate that movie so much.",
                "Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source material. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show and just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with the baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people, one of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in anything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive is a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later see in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other people and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a Disney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it and then she just leaves.",
                "And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death of his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the responsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father, who did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle and making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film, by cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised, and the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children. So at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like, be careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like, what the fuck are they talking about?",
                "What does this have to do with anything we just watched in this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden? This is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the story are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods. In many ways, this theme is the show.",
                "My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a necessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from the narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers from a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why, and what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that.",
                "So, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad, bonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway. But they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing, Does Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the same time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids. It serves a few purposes.",
                "For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character whose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom. It lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like, which is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show. It establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and the Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes, their struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing the same words at the same time for a reason.",
                "And cutting it, instead opening right with Evan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The I Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because generally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a reason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are.",
                "You can't I have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who or what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints. Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general, cuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem.",
                "Because on top of cutting Does Anybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs in the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone who is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets from it are making him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is going great. He keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents, and as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting his friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother.",
                "The Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his own mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled. And Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the lies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the number where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him. They're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable.",
                "How he's only being with these people to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates the emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be discarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the burden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself.",
                "The song is important for several reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are explicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are affecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten.",
                "They are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working. There's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole, and the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again, deepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional comfort to Evan.",
                "It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions. And even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him, where he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real.",
                "And to reduce Heidi to a very limited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with like a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment. There's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a second because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole, the way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story, really acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like we saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a musical is fundamentally supposed to do.",
                "I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical episodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here. In terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time, that adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story.",
                "And that's, again, just a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different time constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new dialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie, or actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy, scripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original, or just things that wouldn't translate well to film. And that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of criticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to reframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage.",
                "And to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it. Beyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one, there are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but really add up.",
                "Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend, is made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made, beyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character.",
                "There is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact that there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do think the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled down to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ representation. I rub my nipples and start glowing with delight. How did you write that? There's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another.",
                "Has been rough. But not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay. But not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure Giving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice.",
                "This also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is the selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over and over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like Evan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions.",
                "Additionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor, and instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially address both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all. So in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret.",
                "Nobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens, and Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened. The film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page. I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied.",
                "Repeatedly. And then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor, who gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic. Evan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the Apple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change, but in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing.",
                "Part of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone bothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually see any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into how this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term. they simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening.",
                "It feels like a change there not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because they want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to adjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's favourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call.",
                "Even if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid. But it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh… Sorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic song.",
                "It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this standard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon. And the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor than the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film.",
                "As previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's home life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality. It's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like while he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around for the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except to say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him on what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab.",
                "Because like what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first 15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's.",
                "She just fucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the musical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience.",
                "You do that. You do that on stage. Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic.",
                "But in all seriousness, what this means is that even though we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This is the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos. The movie drops this entirely.",
                "I get why. Having scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to show on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this means is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely Me, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't really see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant portion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic acoustic radio hit.",
                "And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create more of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's emotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like the film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good apology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words.",
                "The way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material, which already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean and impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution and good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing?",
                "Perhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones that you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form. Things like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face.",
                "They're things you can easily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater theory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is performed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking and cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying to be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly what you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in your room.",
                "It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two different mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage won't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism.",
                "In a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is a real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance. You are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical space that you do.",
                "That means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess is the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then. You can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into another scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would give the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage for the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment.",
                "But I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character interacts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small matter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who don't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set. Considering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience, rooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life.",
                "So a room in a stage show has a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience. And in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception that this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the crowd.",
                "I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the way a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because of the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to, could just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business, or sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film.",
                "Not really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth wall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured. And because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is, we generally expect them to record something matching close to reality.",
                "I don't mean that that we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real life. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists in the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of a believable world to us.",
                "It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in film as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and props tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre. Unless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, what the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly the root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical movies.",
                "If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage, it's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards and understandings of how everything should be presented is… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's especially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage of time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create. It was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents, and then it snowballed out of control from there.",
                "And one of the things this show does do well is to convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing. Evan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world moves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the temporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family.",
                "In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact same feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him. But in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just move around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more grounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't really what we're seeing here.",
                "There are long stretches of time between the things Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really, he could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes, and along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to relate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer. The heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it can't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it, if you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control, you need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to translate that feeling to a more grounded medium.",
                "But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't do that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we see him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create the same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism can actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is The Last Five Years.",
                "For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical musical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual breakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety and insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide to her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and… sorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script, I don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out. The first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective.",
                "Jamie's side of the story is told in chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her, while Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and ending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well, the fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number toward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on stage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the actors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other actor comes in to do their song.",
                "This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have limited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have, and I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference in how the two experience things.",
                "And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the two characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces the idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time, rather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the last five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship, you understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage not working. I say theoretically.",
                "Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show which are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support her and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a successful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for trying to advance his career.",
                "It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out. But then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did Nobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine.",
                "The camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and perspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy that you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment.",
                "But yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because of any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again, we go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with only two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf.",
                "But that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental, and too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set design gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number in it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone. So because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup.",
                "Both of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras in each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie. This should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot more awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of the songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically, solos meant to be performed more at air than at living people.",
                "And because they're now being performed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch and try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance it out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly. The end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play out in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of of the show's impact.",
                "It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the way you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective.",
                "It really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in the first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather just because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working on screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show. And honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted to film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with this. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical, and legit just the direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years.",
                "It follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song, scene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc. There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly different than your average Disney musical when you get down to it. So translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible.",
                "But oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could. There's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's certainly the most notable. Films in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who will say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which just… no.",
                "Like even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing about it. Saying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a subdued opera or a good video game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with.",
                "And yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed by song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern day world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers.",
                "But like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers via staging and blocking not be… bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is going to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one. A musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm. So okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this.",
                "In the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the deviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely hate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million show-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return.",
                "Songs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema. Carnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and show off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments easier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that.",
                "But that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler sequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has to comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie is just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon and sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts that keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting because the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices.",
                "But okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In the Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song. Breathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own anxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming back home.",
                "To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again, we have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The other people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the dances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing you might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness.",
                "The end result is that despite this number being so downbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting something that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music. Now let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song, waving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin? So the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare because this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do. You see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine.",
                "Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room. It's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap.",
                "I understand what they're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like. But they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe.",
                "It's like you don't even want to be around watching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work, it's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin, which is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens.",
                "Once again, you have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around and sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything complex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on. And in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the refrigerator light.",
                "But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the Les Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death, She thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine. Like the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window, and then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun.",
                "And it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an actual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children except this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it.",
                "You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands. Once Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are directed. Once again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here. You see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him and focusing solely on their own lives.",
                "It's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around others. But it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with no real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they just gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song.",
                "And it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too on beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at. Once again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this is how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going to look like when not in anxiety mode.",
                "It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy not actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in the same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it. It just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as Evan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else. way that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers in the film have.",
                "Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and realistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene, the weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it. Dear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to look just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers. It certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever, another Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with Connor to Connor's family.",
                "Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt basically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there. And this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space, wanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes. The stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy House.",
                "The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way too grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels like a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor actually thought of her.",
                "It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is supposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented to Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to stage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it. In the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room, which in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan gets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing a kiss.",
                "It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate as the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final moments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action being Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen. And like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've seen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he wants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out.",
                "It makes a song that was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these flashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while singing about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have, as they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other.",
                "The moments where the two sit beside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good. There's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed up a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all.",
                "Super, super overkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they realized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up and kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just… wild to me. Like, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around.",
                "What would they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops his cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess up his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe what he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad emotional scene, I shit you not.",
                "Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices possible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on shot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes that are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no other interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything.",
                "This can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the way they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore or all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird. And the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated in their own frames, away from each other and across the room.",
                "I'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often. If I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option. But another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions, because yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every shot you see on screen is a very good shot is putting someone's life at risk. So that's something, and would explain why they really try to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames.",
                "There are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall not great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be the best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take shot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers. It really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others. There's also some bit of cinematography I like.",
                "I know I ragged on For Forever, but I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window, Connor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan. It shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail, when we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window, but this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame, showing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid.",
                "It's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job expressing how the characters feel through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best elevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the musical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall problem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard.",
                "Part of the problem with doing the thing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie, is that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel will get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best to ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want you to cry.",
                "That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the entire movie. The weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy. Like, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be. made sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension.",
                "I mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes all in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite the movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour. It's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all in on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the song that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health.",
                "And every single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the story and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this. I'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something, I'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something emotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing the comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless. but weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise.",
                "Dear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main character. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement of that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands the absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human.",
                "By showing him engaging in conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments that are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show and see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played so dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going on. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to think about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think about how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication.",
                "And without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going to drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical numbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material so much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it more, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before. Or at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse.",
                "Musical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work, like how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by changing the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in the real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go, Saying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged.",
                "It's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Hairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable experiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own, away from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension.",
                "And then you have the bad ones, the ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of the original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films, unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these are the only way that most people can experience them.",
                "Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want to experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording, you're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were other options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a musical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time that ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway.",
                "And if the Phantom movie sucks, well, Sorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance. However, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this.",
                "But this increased demand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online. This dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations. Before the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot harder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just google that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily.",
                "Not that I would condone such a thing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime tutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only way for people to consume shows during that time. And I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected the way theatre companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly and super easily.",
                "Someone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know the one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on YouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years. It definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of thing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more shows.",
                "Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's going on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects are still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation.",
                "But if the visuals, or questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage version of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source that's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting recent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new- they've technically been around for a while.",
                "But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film adaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could potentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were generally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be open for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings.",
                "Although, pretty much every show has has a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just that most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact. That being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why you still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't really a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video stuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts.",
                "And it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could change though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD professional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the recording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public.",
                "And sure enough, the mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full theatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead, it was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd, 2020. And it was a huge, huge success.",
                "Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this, the Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show. Whatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton, you'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Hamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly high number.",
                "It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances, audiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place to distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and watch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows they're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them.",
                "And the demand for such things is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will affect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance years before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success. We have seen one, though.",
                "Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a feature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of a live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped. However, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film adaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV.",
                "And while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near as popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material would have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole debate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather have Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better quality product.",
                "And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this is a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that, especially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing, plodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst.",
                "But as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge, it's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't.",
                "And it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films like In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie for real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and don't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening certainly for real this time, guys. I went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because it's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come from a place of hate, but out of love. I love musicals.",
                "I love them a lot. I think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful amalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like a clusterfucked homunculus.",
                "During the writing process, after this script had already been mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell, just from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything about it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many of Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love.",
                "So much of what he's written has resonated with so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible way of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively with other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up to be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the same space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced in another medium. When you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at the same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their very discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but by the fact that it's theatre. This was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has put into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium.",
                "It's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we even get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting on West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's still an audience out there for the musical movie. It's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the video, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting than their stage counterparts.",
                "But these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is and what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting piece of art. One of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals. Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's alive and a little bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little sad to see.",
                "And that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that. In all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over the past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again have to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my favorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of storytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily expect.",
                "In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case study for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a collaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like. People like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice, or even just recently, my co-writer Emily.",
                "For one, it lets us make videos that might not be best suited for YouTube. Like I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which automatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its way onto YouTube. So not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored segments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that you can only find on that platform.",
                "So for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning to become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches. But you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and technology. And it's incredibly cool.",
                "If you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means and how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals and how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really amazing. If you want to watch Debater Theatre, Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical, or anything else on CuriosityStream or Nebula, all you have to do is go to curiositystream.com slash sarahz and use my coupon code sarahz at checkout. You'll get access to both CuriosityStream and Nebula.",

                "734\n00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.930\nPart of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally",

                "740\n00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:56.610\nas normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change",
                "741\n00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.970\nthere not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because",

                "746\n00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.090\nfavourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call.",
                "747\n00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.650\nEven if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid.",
                "748\n00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:37.970\nBut it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh…",
                "749\n00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:43.210\nSorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic",

                "752\n00:39:53.090 --> 00:40:04.330\nAnd the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor",
                "753\n00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:10.090\nthan the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film.",
                "754\n00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.730\nAs previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's",

                "759\n00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.990\nto say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout",

Get access to CuriosityStream and my streaming service Nebula and watch my Nebula exclusive video, Debater Theater at curiositystream.com slash sarahz. Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video, um, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that you're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just giving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a breaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly producing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right? Um, on a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it? So you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking on this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good. Not only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was also just a pretty bad film in its own right. And all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels that have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie. Though out of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is titled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite. But Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been in the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably hearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film adaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting to come to fruition. Both casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that of Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with lots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters start their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even if they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role and just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen. Dear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously bad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to play a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually just looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps happening. We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these embarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations that are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly muted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have you. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just… fascinating. And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking about adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear Evan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the translation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals in general. So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal? So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015. When the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously thinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it. You know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up, and Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who did do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight. So, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be referenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer. I saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything. Evan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins, which is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc. He struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real friends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house, her family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity, and he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles, and prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor. Evan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter on him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their four best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong-armed and interrupted the first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along with the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along He gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him as a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes viral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died. We also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is extremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also either suicidal or just mentally ill in general, and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to hide that fact. In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's family is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up confessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts to repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year later, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and the two of them reflect on all of what happened. The musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number of changes made from the final edition. There was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts and apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut. You can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff like the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call. It was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna be in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same throughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows. One notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of Alana who went through a different actor at every reading. They were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who they wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines through most performances and adaptations of the show. When they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the project. It's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview period- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really wasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead of just dropping the show is extremely funny, though. According to Justin Paul, one of the three people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot take Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they finally had a finished show. And this thing was a huge fucking hit. Dear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety of different reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show, its representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships between all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen and his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people felt that it was able to create. Not only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had the musical up against a number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them, also including Best Musical. Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the show later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all of these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog Day I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of tickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept. But Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically impressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the very least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten. And while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award success and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social media platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise of shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy, or to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only get that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have been friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well, what if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together? So you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen, or just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success and popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had. This has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather got, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community as of late. Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head, I can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their primary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and they tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway. Nowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's, which ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following in two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for so much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning Thief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers and popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness. Shows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly to a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too. This divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever, but usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act politely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like, existing in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them. That critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are, while not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens. Shows like Mean Girls or Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex, relatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a limited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right now and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible tends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation for such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good. So as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans who only like teen musicals thing. That being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter, and the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not liking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical would get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action Beauty and the Beast. Another thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced and started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people would hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume it's a coming out story about a gay kid. I did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this. So when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia page for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family whose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter and also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what the fuck? So there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is a musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible and bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show handles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal with how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately by the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed. Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had a lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like The Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was actually about. And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures of Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school student, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse. So you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question of like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source material poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like, its source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material, and the other is a failure to adapt it correctly. So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good? Both in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about mental health. Eh. It was fine. Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor you see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts grief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done, there are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story. Especially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom. It manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms trying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him, we are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection with his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan with a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son while having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like, social media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come with a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less as their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity. There's a lot to like about this show, and I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window, connected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times, and every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me reconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that. But it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show. There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of the songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important character of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature, but songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good. The show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in their full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it first came out was its depiction of social media. Because like, yeah, we do see that a little. Evan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube. My speech? People started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere. Your speech is everywhere. This morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it. How many does it have now? 4,580. 16,239! He is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and the less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the less likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how we're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment of yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of abusive comments and phone calls online. So it's definitely a present theme in the show, but it's very much only explored on a surface level. We don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean on it sometimes and going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising money, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows him to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared to in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way. There are weird little mental health nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off his meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words, he doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it. And I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad things, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more kind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it. But it does at times struggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense. One of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful, and having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love, and Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't really talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good than bad, which is an interesting message. I don't… really agree with this point about punishment. Mostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see evildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want? He loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part of that family anymore. Do you want him to go to child jail too  What? But at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much beaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately. But at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications for others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because of something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible good that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again, there's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can do to a person, and they just don't. And finally, there's the fact that, for all the show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and whatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really more a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story centering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his life are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques is the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by others, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to. But I think the message is weakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor, or to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end up being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly uncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself. And then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work. Alana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing the lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be a suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan. A depressed girl who, instead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending on how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which is largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike Evan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations besides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between either a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles. It's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that Alana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really work. And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show, be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is really… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love it, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either hate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely mid-tier show. One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths, but at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future version of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of those aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut out the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked. And actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out stuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work. So like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is bad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from an adaptational standpoint. Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in general. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's to be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible from the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film is always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie musicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original. But then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen. And there's just so much here that's just really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie. Very much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting, and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild. I will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and that is the fact that James Corden is not in it. Other than that, there's a lot to look at here. So Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film back in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation. He originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician like a year prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be Ben Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at this point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look old. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late twenties. Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly look like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from watching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much younger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter. Also, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer eraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak. But the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually fucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage, and makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how exactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up getting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something. Evan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally not as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on stage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done and as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid. He's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt on camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are watching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable to us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance section feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought him this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that we're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music. And the thing is, this is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's Broadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors in their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your casting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is. is. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening on stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story. So this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social media posts will pop up throughout the show. This is obviously like a metaphorical representation of social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience, convey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its faults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage. The way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt, isn't literal. There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things will act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a representation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much. Half the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more complicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't just fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and costumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like a literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role, it's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping into the space. The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best best most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a movie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more literal representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look really fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close, and in a much more grounded and realistic setting. So when you're making a movie, whether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a lot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever you're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active effort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls apart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit, if your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl Streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods, which is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the the more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed back into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action film just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the film with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like very… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags under her eyes. She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a fetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and she would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout every scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well, the differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context of its realism. In terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine. There were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super in depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor playing that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women. But other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their job. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the unfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still hinges on Evan. Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone else. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this show comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled into the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the story because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen looks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way that we could on stage. But even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still can't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go beyond just who is acting in it. Another really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music, And the film unfortunately fucks this up too. So something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted to film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen. You are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going to be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical. So for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're the wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations like Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful Ghosts from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this is just something you're going to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always bad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies' Choice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more of a chance to sing. But these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical. Part of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the films is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song. Which you know is fine. If they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure. But it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were these deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like, come on. We all know that that is absolutely never the real reason. It sucks. But it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward places in the story, and two, the songs being very generic. That was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of the context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the time when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original music, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later. But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with Alana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the original show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the only one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we don't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out in the film's favour. Unfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental health, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea that lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering in this way. In terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where we didn't see much of it in the show. So in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg plays Alana. I'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was how they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because it's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film. I'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including ones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the most dour, depressing way possible. Everyone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental health, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very depressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film. He thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. He did? He thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. But Alana as a character especially suffers from this. In the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira. So what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs and achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness. Hey, how was your summer? Mine was productive. I did three internships and 90 hours of community service. The idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone like Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable. But the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks to Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really. You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications. Well, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June. We were in school in June. So for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes, hey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad a lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who delivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life and her own struggles because that was missing in the original show. And we do have one of those rare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap in the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story and or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that were removed in the film. This is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top of being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend to be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less without the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth. So when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes, certain songs are just going to have to get cut. Or sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they do in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably never should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could have pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning isn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty. But these things don't just affect the cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs  that having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally speaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when a song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it being you sing when you can no longer speak. These tend to be points of heightened emotion that are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader story. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because it sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about with one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about their complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these characters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue. The song is really important, and it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate that movie. I hate that movie so much. Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source material. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show and just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with the baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people, one of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in anything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive is a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later see in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other people and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a Disney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it and then she just leaves. And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death of his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the responsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father, who did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle and making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film, by cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised, and the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children. So at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like, be careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like, what the fuck are they talking about? What does this have to do with anything we just watched in this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden? This is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the story are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods. In many ways, this theme is the show. My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a necessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from the narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers from a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why, and what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that. So, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad, bonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway. But they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing, Does Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the same time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids. It serves a few purposes. For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character whose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom. It lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like, which is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show. It establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and the Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes, their struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing the same words at the same time for a reason. And cutting it, instead opening right with Evan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The I Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because generally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a reason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are. You can't I have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who or what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints. Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general, cuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem. Because on top of cutting Does Anybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs in the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone who is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets from it are making him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is going great. He keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents, and as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting his friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother. The Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his own mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled. And Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the lies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the number where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him. They're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable. How he's only being with these people to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates the emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be discarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the burden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself. The song is important for several reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are explicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are affecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten. They are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working. There's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole, and the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again, deepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional comfort to Evan. It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions. And even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him, where he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real. And to reduce Heidi to a very limited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with like a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment. There's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a second because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole, the way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story, really acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like we saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a musical is fundamentally supposed to do. I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical episodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here. In terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time, that adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story. And that's, again, just a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different time constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new dialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie, or actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy, scripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original, or just things that wouldn't translate well to film. And that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of criticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to reframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage. And to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it. Beyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one, there are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but really add up. Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend, is made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made, beyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character. There is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact that there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do think the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled down to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ representation. I rub my nipples and start glowing with delight. How did you write that? There's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another. Has been rough. But not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay. But not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure Giving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice. This also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is the selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over and over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like Evan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions. Additionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor, and instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially address both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all. So in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret. Nobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens, and Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened. The film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page. I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied. Repeatedly. And then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor, who gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic. Evan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the Apple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change, but in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing. Part of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone bothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually see any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into how this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term. they simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change there not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because they want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to adjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's favourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call. Even if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid. But it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh… Sorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic song. It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this standard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon. And the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor than the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film. As previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's home life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality. It's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like while he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around for the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except to say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him on what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab. Because like what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first 15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's. She just fucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the musical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience. You do that. You do that on stage. Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic. But in all seriousness, what this means is that even though we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This is the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos. The movie drops this entirely. I get why. Having scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to show on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this means is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely Me, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't really see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant portion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic acoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create more of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's emotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like the film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good apology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words. The way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material, which already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean and impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution and good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing? Perhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones that you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form. Things like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face. They're things you can easily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater theory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is performed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking and cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying to be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly what you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in your room. It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two different mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage won't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism. In a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is a real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance. You are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical space that you do. That means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess is the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then. You can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into another scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would give the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage for the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment. But I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character interacts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small matter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who don't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set. Considering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience, rooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life. So a room in a stage show has a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience. And in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception that this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the crowd. I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the way a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because of the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to, could just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business, or sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film. Not really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth wall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured. And because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is, we generally expect them to record something matching close to reality. I don't mean that that we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real life. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists in the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of a believable world to us. It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in film as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and props tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre. Unless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, what the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly the root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical movies. If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage, it's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards and understandings of how everything should be presented  is… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's especially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage of time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create. It was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents, and then it snowballed out of control from there. And one of the things this show does do well is to convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing. Evan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world moves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the temporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family. In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact same feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him. But in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just move around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more grounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't really what we're seeing here. There are long stretches of time between the things Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really, he could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes, and along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to relate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer. The heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it can't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it, if you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control, you need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to translate that feeling to a more grounded medium. But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't do that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we see him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create the same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism can actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is The Last Five Years. For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical musical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual breakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety and insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide to her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and… sorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script, I don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out. The first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective. Jamie's side of the story is told in chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her, while Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and ending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well, the fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number toward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on stage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the actors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other actor comes in to do their song. This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have limited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have, and I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference in how the two experience things. And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the two characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces the idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time, rather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the last five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship, you understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage not working. I say theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show which are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support her and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a successful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for trying to advance his career. It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out. But then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did Nobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine. The camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and perspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy that you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment. But yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because of any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again, we go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with only two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf. But that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental, and too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set design gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number in it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone. So because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup. Both of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras in each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie. This should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot more awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of the songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically, solos meant to be performed more at air than at living people. And because they're now being performed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch and try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance it out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly. The end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play out in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of of the show's impact. It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the way you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective. It really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in the first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather just because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working on screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show. And honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted to film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with this. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical, and legit just the direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years. It follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song, scene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc. There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly different than your average Disney musical when you get down to it. So translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible. But oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could. There's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's certainly the most notable. Films in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who will say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which just… no. Like even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing about it. Saying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a subdued opera or a good video game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with. And yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed by song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern day world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers. But like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers via staging and blocking not be… bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is going to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one. A musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm. So okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this. In the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the deviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely hate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million show-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return. Songs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema. Carnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and show off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments easier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that. But that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler sequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has to comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie is just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon and sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts that keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting because the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices. But okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In the Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song. Breathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own anxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming back home. To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again, we have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The other people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the dances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing you might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result is that despite this number being so downbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting something that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music. Now let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song, waving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin? So the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare because this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do. You see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine. Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room. It's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap. I understand what they're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like. But they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's like you don't even want to be around watching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work, it's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin, which is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once again, you have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around and sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything complex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on. And in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the refrigerator light. But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the Les Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death, She thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine. Like the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window, and then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun. And it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an actual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children except this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it. You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands. Once Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are directed. Once again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here. You see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him and focusing solely on their own lives. It's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around others. But it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with no real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they just gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song. And it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too on beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at. Once again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this is how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going to look like when not in anxiety mode. It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy not actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in the same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it. It just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as Evan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else. way that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers in the film have. Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and realistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene, the weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it. Dear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to look just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers. It certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever, another Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with Connor to Connor's family. Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt basically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there. And this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space, wanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes. The stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy House. The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way too grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels like a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor actually thought of her. It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is supposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented to Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to stage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it. In the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room, which in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan gets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing a kiss. It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate as the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final moments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action being Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen. And like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've seen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he wants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out. It makes a song that was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these flashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while singing about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have, as they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other. The moments where the two sit beside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good. There's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed up a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all. Super, super overkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they realized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up and kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just… wild to me. Like, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around. What would they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops his cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess up his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe what he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad emotional scene, I shit you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices possible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on shot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes that are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no other interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything. This can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the way they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore or all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird. And the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated in their own frames, away from each other and across the room. I'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often. If I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option. But another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions, because yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every shot you see on screen is a very good shot  is putting someone's life at risk. So that's something, and would explain why they really try to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames. There are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall not great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be the best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take shot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers. It really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others. There's also some bit of cinematography I like. I know I ragged on For Forever, but I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window, Connor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan. It shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail, when we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window, but this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame, showing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid. It's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job expressing how the characters feel through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best elevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the musical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall problem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard. Part of the problem with doing the thing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie, is that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel will get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best to ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want you to cry. That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the entire movie. The weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy. Like, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be. made sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension. I mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes all in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite the movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour. It's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all in on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the song that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health. And every single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the story and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this. I'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something, I'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something emotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing the comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless. but weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise. Dear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main character. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement of that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands the absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human. By showing him engaging in conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments that are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show and see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played so dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going on. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to think about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think about how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication. And without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going to drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical numbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material so much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it more, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before. Or at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse. Musical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work, like how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by changing the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in the real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go, Saying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged. It's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Hairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable experiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own, away from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension. And then you have the bad ones, the ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of the original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films, unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these are the only way that most people can experience them. Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want to experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording, you're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were other options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a musical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time that ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom movie sucks, well, Sorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance. However, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this. But this increased demand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online. This dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations. Before the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot harder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just google that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily. Not that I would condone such a thing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime tutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only way for people to consume shows during that time. And I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected the way theatre companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly and super easily. Someone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know the one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on YouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years. It definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of thing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more shows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's going on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects are still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation. But if the visuals, or questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage version of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source that's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting recent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new- they've technically been around for a while. But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film adaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could potentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were generally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be open for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Although, pretty much every show has has a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just that most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact. That being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why you still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't really a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video stuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts. And it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could change though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD professional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the recording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public. And sure enough, the mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full theatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead, it was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd, 2020. And it was a huge, huge success. Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this, the Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show. Whatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton, you'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Hamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly high number. It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances, audiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place to distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and watch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows they're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them. And the demand for such things is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will affect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance years before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success. We have seen one, though. Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a feature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of a live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped. However, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film adaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV. And while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near as popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material would have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole debate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather have Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better quality product. And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this is a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that, especially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing, plodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst. But as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge, it's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't. And it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films like In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie for real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and don't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening certainly for real this time, guys. I went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because it's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come from a place of hate, but out of love. I love musicals. I love them a lot. I think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful amalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like a clusterfucked homunculus. During the writing process, after this script had already been mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell, just from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything about it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many of Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love. So much of what he's written has resonated with so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible way of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively with other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up to be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the same space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced in another medium. When you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at the same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their very discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but by the fact that it's theatre. This was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has put into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium. It's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we even get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting on West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's still an audience out there for the musical movie. It's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the video, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting than their stage counterparts. But these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is and what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting piece of art. One of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals. Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's alive and a little bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little sad to see. And that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that. In all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over the past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again have to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my favorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of storytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily expect. In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case study for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a collaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like. People like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice, or even just recently, my co-writer Emily. For one, it lets us make videos that might not be best suited for YouTube. Like I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which automatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its way onto YouTube. So not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored segments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that you can only find on that platform. So for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning to become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches. But you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and technology. And it's incredibly cool. If you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means and how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals and how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really amazing. If you want to watch Debater Theatre, Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical, or anything else on CuriosityStream or Nebula, all you have to do is go to curiositystream.com slash sarahz and use my coupon code sarahz at checkout.

Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video,\n\n4\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.400\num, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that\n\n5\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.440\nyou're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just\n\n6\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.940\ngiving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a\n\n7\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.600\nbreaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly\n\n8\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.020\nproducing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right? Um,\n\n9\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.240\non a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it?\n\n10\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.460\nSo you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking\n\n11\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.000\non this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical\n\n12\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.600\nDear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good.\n\n13\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440\nNot only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was\n\n14\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.660\nalso just a pretty bad film in its own right.\n\n15\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.220\nAnd all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels\n\n16\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.500\nthat have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie. Though\n\n17\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.320\nout of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is\n\n18\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.460\ntitled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite.\n\n19\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.620\nBut Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been\n\n20\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.080\nin the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably\n\n21\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.300\nhearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film\n\n22\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920\nadaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting\n\n23\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.580\nto come to fruition.\n\n24\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.000\nBoth casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that\n\n25\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.300\nof Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with\n\n26\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.700\nlots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters\n\n27\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.079\nstart their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even\n\n28\n00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.140\nif they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role\n\n29\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.660\nand just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen.\n\n30\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.300\nDear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously\n\n31\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.140\nbad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to\n\n32\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.540\nplay a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually\n\n33\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.660\njust looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were\n\n34\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.620\nTom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps\n\n35\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.540\nhappening. We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these\n\n36\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.540\nembarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations\n\n37\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.620\nthat are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly\n\n38\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.140\nmuted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have\n\n39\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.340\nyou. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just…\n\n40\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.220\nfascinating. And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking\n\n41\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.100\nabout adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear\n\n42\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.540\nEvan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the\n\n43\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.140\ntranslation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals\n\n44\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.860\nin general. So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal?\n\n45\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.340\nSo Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015.\n\n46\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.820\nWhen the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously\n\n47\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.700\nthinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it.\n\n48\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.579\nYou know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up,\n\n49\n00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.380\nand Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who\n\n50\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.180\ndid do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight.\n\n51\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.580\nSo, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be\n\n52\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.420\nreferenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about,\n\n53\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.580\nthe show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer.\n\n54\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.220\nI saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything.\n\n55\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.540\nEvan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety,\n\n56\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.500\nand we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins,\n\n57\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.180\nwhich is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc.\n\n58\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.980\nHe struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real\n\n59\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.340\nfriends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house,\n\n60\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.260\nher family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being\n\n61\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.540\nvery mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity,\n\n62\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.340\nand he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles,\n\n63\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.620\nand prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor.\n\n64\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.260\nEvan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter\n\n65\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.060\non him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their\n\n66\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.420\nfour best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong-armed and interrupted\n\n67\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.540\nthe first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along\n\n68\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:08.122\nwith the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along\n\n69\n00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:12.262\nHe gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him\n\n70\n00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:17.342\nas a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes\n\n71\n00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:21.102\nviral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died.\n\n72\n00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:25.882\nWe also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is\n\n73\n00:06:25.882 --> 00:06:31.722\nextremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name.\n\n74\n00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:38.442\nHer own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also\n\n75\n00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:44.202\neither suicidal or just mentally ill in general, and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars\n\n76\n00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:49.882\nto hide that fact. In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately\n\n77\n00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:55.482\nhe cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's\n\n78\n00:06:55.482 --> 00:07:00.282\nfamily is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up\n\n79\n00:07:00.282 --> 00:07:05.162\nconfessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with\n\n80\n00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:11.642\nEvan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts\n\n81\n00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:17.082\nto repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year\n\n82\n00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:22.362\nlater, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and\n\n83\n00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:25.822\nthe two of them reflect on all of what happened.\n\n84\n00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:30.022\nThe musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number\n\n85\n00:07:30.022 --> 00:07:32.522\nof changes made from the final edition.\n\n86\n00:07:32.522 --> 00:07:36.662\nThere was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts\n\n87\n00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:40.982\nand apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut.\n\n88\n00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:45.262\nYou can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff\n\n89\n00:07:45.262 --> 00:07:50.942\nlike the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call.\n\n90\n00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:55.302\nIt was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna\n\n91\n00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:59.882\nbe in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same\n\n92\n00:07:59.882 --> 00:08:04.942\nthroughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows.\n\n93\n00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:08.962\nOne notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of\n\n94\n00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:12.482\nAlana who went through a different actor at every reading.\n\n95\n00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:16.482\nThey were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who\n\n96\n00:08:16.482 --> 00:08:22.162\nthey wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines\n\n97\n00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:25.382\nthrough most performances and adaptations of the show.\n\n98\n00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:28.802\nWhen they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly\n\n99\n00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:32.861\nenough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the\n\n100\n00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:33.861\nproject.\n\n101\n00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:37.342\nIt's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview\n\n102\n00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:41.462\nperiod- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really\n\n103\n00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:46.562\nwasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead\n\n104\n00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:51.522\nof just dropping the show is extremely funny, though. According to Justin Paul, one of the\n\n105\n00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:57.982\nthree people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben\n\n106\n00:08:57.982 --> 00:09:02.682\nPlatt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot\n\n107\n00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:08.462\ntake Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive.\n\n108\n00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:13.622\nSo they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they\n\n109\n00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:16.102\nfinally had a finished show.\n\n110\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:18.822\nAnd this thing was a huge fucking hit.\n\n111\n00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:24.402\nDear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety\n\n112\n00:09:24.402 --> 00:09:25.862\nof different reasons.\n\n113\n00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:30.942\nThe inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show,\n\n114\n00:09:30.942 --> 00:09:36.002\nits representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships\n\n115\n00:09:36.002 --> 00:09:40.682\nbetween all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen\n\n116\n00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:46.742\nand his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people\n\n117\n00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:48.722\nfelt that it was able to create.\n\n118\n00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:53.342\nNot only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in\n\n119\n00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:58.442\nterms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had\n\n120\n00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:02.242\nthe musical up against a number of other quite good shows.\n\n121\n00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:07.762\nDear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them,\n\n122\n00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:11.902\nalso including Best Musical. Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the\n\n123\n00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:16.602\nshow later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all\n\n124\n00:10:16.602 --> 00:10:22.702\nof these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog\n\n125\n00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:27.082\nDay I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of\n\n126\n00:10:27.082 --> 00:10:32.442\ntickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept.\n\n127\n00:10:32.442 --> 00:10:37.642\nBut Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically\n\n128\n00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:42.522\nimpressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly\n\n129\n00:10:42.522 --> 00:10:48.602\nsimple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the\n\n130\n00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:53.082\nvery least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten.\n\n131\n00:10:53.082 --> 00:10:58.282\nAnd while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award\n\n132\n00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:03.962\nsuccess and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social\n\n133\n00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:09.242\nmedia platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise\n\n134\n00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:15.482\nof shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy,\n\n135\n00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:21.002\nor to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only\n\n136\n00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:26.442\nget that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have\n\n137\n00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:31.242\nbeen friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well,\n\n138\n00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:36.202\nwhat if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together?\n\n139\n00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:41.962\nSo you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen,\n\n140\n00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:47.322\nor just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success\n\n141\n00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:55.322\nand popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had.\n\n142\n00:11:55.322 --> 00:12:13.364\nThis has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather\n\n143\n00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:18.244\ngot, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens\n\n144\n00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:23.204\nor marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community\n\n145\n00:12:23.204 --> 00:12:28.964\nas of late. Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head,\n\n146\n00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:34.564\nI can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their\n\n147\n00:12:34.564 --> 00:12:40.164\nprimary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and\n\n148\n00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:45.204\nthey tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway.\n\n149\n00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:49.524\nNowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's,\n\n150\n00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:54.324\nwhich ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following\n\n151\n00:12:54.324 --> 00:13:00.244\nin two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really\n\n152\n00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:05.764\nexploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for\n\n153\n00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:10.484\nso much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning\n\n154\n00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:16.964\nThief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers\n\n155\n00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:20.964\nand popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness.\n\n156\n00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:26.964\nShows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly\n\n157\n00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:32.644\nto a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too.\n\n158\n00:13:32.644 --> 00:13:37.924\nThis divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever,\n\n159\n00:13:37.924 --> 00:13:43.764\nbut usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act\n\n160\n00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:49.844\npolitely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like,\n\n161\n00:13:49.844 --> 00:13:54.964\nexisting in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them.\n\n162\n00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:58.884\nThat critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are,\n\n163\n00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:06.084\nwhile not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens. Shows like Mean Girls or Be\n\n164\n00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:12.484\nMore Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex,\n\n165\n00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:18.484\nrelatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration,\n\n166\n00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:23.044\nthen, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a\n\n167\n00:14:23.044 --> 00:14:28.964\nlimited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right\n\n168\n00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:35.044\nnow and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting.\n\n169\n00:14:35.044 --> 00:14:40.484\nAt the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible\n\n170\n00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:45.944\ntends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation\n\n171\n00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:51.724\nfor such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people,\n\n172\n00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:56.604\nhonestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good.\n\n173\n00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:02.124\nSo as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway\n\n174\n00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:04.404\nfans who only like teen musicals thing.\n\n175\n00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:09.324\nThat being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter,\n\n176\n00:15:09.324 --> 00:15:13.624\nand the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive\n\n177\n00:15:13.624 --> 00:15:19.864\nmusicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated.\n\n178\n00:15:19.864 --> 00:15:24.324\nDespite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not\n\n179\n00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:28.524\nliking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial\n\n180\n00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:33.804\nand fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical\n\n181\n00:15:33.804 --> 00:15:38.404\nwould get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being\n\n182\n00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:43.464\na Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action\n\n183\n00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:44.724\nBeauty and the Beast.\n\n184\n00:15:44.724 --> 00:15:49.524\nAnother thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced\n\n185\n00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:54.364\nand started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people\n\n186\n00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:59.644\nwould hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because,\n\n187\n00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:03.844\ny'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume\n\n188\n00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:06.064\nit's a coming out story about a gay kid.\n\n189\n00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:11.124\nI did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this.\n\n190\n00:16:11.124 --> 00:16:15.384\nSo when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia\n\n191\n00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:20.564\npage for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family\n\n192\n00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:24.984\nwhose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter\n\n193\n00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:29.304\nand also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be\n\n194\n00:16:29.304 --> 00:16:31.564\nlike, what the fuck?\n\n195\n00:16:31.564 --> 00:16:35.744\nSo there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is\n\n196\n00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.904\na musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible\n\n197\n00:16:39.904 --> 00:16:45.564\nand bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show\n\n198\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:49.764\nhandles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal\n\n199\n00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:54.504\nwith how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately\n\n200\n00:16:54.504 --> 00:17:01.444\nby the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then\n\n201\n00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:07.084\nwent, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed. Fucked up.\n\n202\n00:17:07.263 --> 00:17:12.464\nSo rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced,\n\n203\n00:17:12.644 --> 00:17:18.124\nincluding Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had\n\n204\n00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:22.664\na lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like\n\n205\n00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:27.644\nThe Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was\n\n206\n00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:33.084\nactually about. And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures\n\n207\n00:17:33.084 --> 00:17:38.204\nof Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school\n\n208\n00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:44.124\nstudent, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying\n\n209\n00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:50.124\nthe upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse.\n\n210\n00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:55.404\nSo you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question\n\n211\n00:17:55.404 --> 00:18:10.706\nof like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source\n\n212\n00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:16.466\nmaterial poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like,\n\n213\n00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:21.666\nits source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material,\n\n214\n00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:28.706\nand the other is a failure to adapt it correctly. So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good?\n\n215\n00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:33.666\nBoth in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about\n\n216\n00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:41.986\nmental health. Eh. It was fine. Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor\n\n217\n00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:47.666\nyou see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts\n\n218\n00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:52.706\ngrief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done,\n\n219\n00:18:52.706 --> 00:18:58.306\nthere are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story.\n\n220\n00:18:58.306 --> 00:19:03.186\nEspecially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom.\n\n221\n00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:08.786\nIt manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms\n\n222\n00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:14.466\ntrying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him,\n\n223\n00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:19.906\nwe are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection\n\n224\n00:19:19.906 --> 00:19:25.026\nwith his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan\n\n225\n00:19:25.026 --> 00:19:30.946\nwith a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son\n\n226\n00:19:30.946 --> 00:19:36.466\nwhile having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like,\n\n227\n00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:40.466\nsocial media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand.\n\n228\n00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:45.506\nI think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come\n\n229\n00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:49.986\nwith a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less\n\n230\n00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:55.266\nas their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize\n\n231\n00:19:55.266 --> 00:20:01.026\nsomething in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity. There's a lot to like about this show,\n\n232\n00:20:01.026 --> 00:20:05.586\nand I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window,\n\n233\n00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:10.626\nconnected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times,\n\n234\n00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:15.586\nand every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me\n\n235\n00:20:15.586 --> 00:20:19.586\nreconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that.\n\n236\n00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:27.186\nBut it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show.\n\n237\n00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:31.986\nThere's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of\n\n238\n00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:37.266\nthe songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important\n\n239\n00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:42.306\ncharacter of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature,\n\n240\n00:20:42.306 --> 00:20:47.746\nbut songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good.\n\n241\n00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:52.226\nThe show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in\n\n242\n00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:56.786\ntheir full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it\n\n243\n00:20:56.786 --> 00:21:02.066\nfirst came out was its depiction of social media. Because like, yeah, we do see that a little.\n\n244\n00:21:02.066 --> 00:21:07.106\nEvan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor\n\n245\n00:21:07.106 --> 00:21:08.786\ngoes viral on YouTube.\n\n246\n00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:09.786\nMy speech?\n\n247\n00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:12.866\nPeople started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere.\n\n248\n00:21:12.866 --> 00:21:14.466\nYour speech is everywhere.\n\n249\n00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:18.786\nThis morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it.\n\n250\n00:21:18.786 --> 00:21:20.226\nHow many does it have now?\n\n251\n00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:21.226\n4,580.\n\n252\n00:21:21.226 --> 00:21:25.166\n16,239!\n\n253\n00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:30.546\nHe is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and\n\n254\n00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:35.386\nthe less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the\n\n255\n00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:40.386\nless likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how\n\n256\n00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:45.426\nwe're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment\n\n257\n00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:51.706\nof yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving\n\n258\n00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:56.786\nfamily is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of\n\n259\n00:21:56.786 --> 00:22:02.146\nabusive comments and phone calls online. So it's definitely a present theme in the\n\n260\n00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:06.626\nshow, but it's very much only explored on a surface level.\n\n261\n00:22:06.626 --> 00:22:11.326\nWe don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean\n\n262\n00:22:11.326 --> 00:22:14.266\non it sometimes and going viral is weird.\n\n263\n00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:18.026\nHis internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising\n\n264\n00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:22.906\nmoney, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows\n\n265\n00:22:22.906 --> 00:22:28.226\nhim to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared\n\n266\n00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:33.906\nto in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure,\n\n267\n00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:39.986\nbut it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way. There are weird little mental\n\n268\n00:22:39.986 --> 00:22:45.106\nhealth nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off\n\n269\n00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:50.226\nhis meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words,\n\n270\n00:22:50.226 --> 00:22:55.106\nhe doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it.\n\n271\n00:22:55.106 --> 00:23:00.066\nAnd I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad\n\n272\n00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:05.106\nthings, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more\n\n273\n00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:10.626\nkind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it. But it does at times\n\n274\n00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:14.946\nstruggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense.\n\n275\n00:23:14.946 --> 00:23:19.986\nOne of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently\n\n276\n00:23:19.986 --> 00:23:25.026\npunished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful,\n\n277\n00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:28.706\nand having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love,\n\n278\n00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:33.986\nand Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't\n\n279\n00:23:33.986 --> 00:23:39.666\nreally talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good\n\n280\n00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:47.106\nthan bad, which is an interesting message. I don't… really agree with this point about punishment.\n\n281\n00:23:47.106 --> 00:23:51.866\nMostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see\n\n282\n00:23:51.866 --> 00:23:57.426\nevildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want?\n\n283\n00:23:57.426 --> 00:24:01.546\nHe loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part\n\n284\n00:24:01.546 --> 00:24:03.286\nof that family anymore.\n\n285\n00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.966\nDo you want him to go to child jail too?\n\n286\n00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:06.966\nWhat?\n\n287\n00:24:06.966 --> 00:24:13.526\nBut at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's\n\n288\n00:24:13.526 --> 00:24:14.526\nactions.\n\n289\n00:24:14.526 --> 00:24:18.326\nThey're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much\n\n290\n00:24:18.326 --> 00:24:23.666\nbeaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately.\n\n291\n00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:28.846\nBut at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications\n\n292\n00:24:28.846 --> 00:24:34.426\nfor others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because\n\n293\n00:24:34.426 --> 00:24:38.926\nof something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible\n\n294\n00:24:38.926 --> 00:24:44.246\ngood that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again,\n\n295\n00:24:44.246 --> 00:24:48.806\nthere's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can\n\n296\n00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:54.546\ndo to a person, and they just don't. And finally, there's the fact that, for all\n\n297\n00:24:54.546 --> 00:24:59.766\nthe show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and\n\n298\n00:24:59.766 --> 00:25:06.046\nwhatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really\n\n299\n00:25:06.046 --> 00:25:11.946\nmore a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story\n\n300\n00:25:11.946 --> 00:25:17.526\ncentering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his\n\n301\n00:25:17.526 --> 00:25:22.946\nlife are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques\n\n302\n00:25:22.946 --> 00:25:29.006\nis the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by\n\n303\n00:25:29.006 --> 00:25:34.286\nothers, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to. But I think the message is\n\n304\n00:25:34.286 --> 00:25:39.806\nweakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor,\n\n305\n00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:45.566\nor to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end\n\n306\n00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:51.326\nup being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly\n\n307\n00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:57.006\nuncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself.\n\n308\n00:25:57.006 --> 00:26:01.726\nAnd then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work.\n\n309\n00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:07.886\nAlana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing\n\n310\n00:26:07.886 --> 00:26:13.006\nthe lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be\n\n311\n00:26:13.006 --> 00:26:19.326\na suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan. A depressed girl who,\n\n312\n00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:25.246\ninstead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular\n\n313\n00:26:25.246 --> 00:26:30.766\npossible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending\n\n314\n00:26:30.766 --> 00:26:35.626\non how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which\n\n315\n00:26:35.626 --> 00:26:40.426\nis largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike\n\n316\n00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:47.006\nEvan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she\n\n317\n00:26:47.006 --> 00:26:52.466\ndoesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations\n\n318\n00:26:52.466 --> 00:26:57.506\nbesides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between\n\n319\n00:26:57.506 --> 00:27:03.586\neither a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles.\n\n320\n00:27:03.586 --> 00:27:08.386\nIt's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that\n\n321\n00:27:08.386 --> 00:27:13.746\nAlana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really\n\n322\n00:27:13.746 --> 00:27:19.106\nwork. And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show,\n\n323\n00:27:19.106 --> 00:27:25.346\nbe kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is\n\n324\n00:27:25.346 --> 00:27:30.546\nreally… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love\n\n325\n00:27:30.546 --> 00:27:34.786\nit, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either\n\n326\n00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:40.786\nhate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely\n\n327\n00:27:40.786 --> 00:27:45.746\nmid-tier show. One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths,\n\n328\n00:27:45.746 --> 00:27:51.586\nbut at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future\n\n329\n00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:56.866\nversion of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of\n\n330\n00:27:56.866 --> 00:28:02.466\nthose aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut\n\n331\n00:28:02.466 --> 00:28:10.066\nout the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked.\n\n332\n00:28:10.066 --> 00:28:14.786\nAnd actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out\n\n333\n00:28:14.786 --> 00:28:20.866\nstuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work.\n\n334\n00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:25.545\nSo like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is\n\n335\n00:28:25.545 --> 00:28:29.566\nbad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from\n\n336\n00:28:29.566 --> 00:28:34.846\nan adaptational standpoint. Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway\n\n337\n00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:39.466\nmusical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in\n\n338\n00:28:39.466 --> 00:28:44.786\ngeneral. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's\n\n339\n00:28:44.786 --> 00:28:49.186\nto be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible\n\n340\n00:28:49.186 --> 00:28:55.026\nfrom the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film\n\n341\n00:28:55.026 --> 00:29:00.626\nis always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie\n\n342\n00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:07.186\nmusicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original.\n\n343\n00:29:07.186 --> 00:29:13.266\nBut then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen. And there's just so much here that's\n\n344\n00:29:13.266 --> 00:29:18.946\njust really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie.\n\n345\n00:29:19.506 --> 00:29:24.626\nVery much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting,\n\n346\n00:29:24.626 --> 00:29:30.306\nand specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild.\n\n347\n00:29:37.106 --> 00:29:41.826\nI will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film,\n\n348\n00:29:41.826 --> 00:29:48.146\nand that is the fact that James Corden is not in it. Other than that, there's a lot to look at here.\n\n349\n00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:53.826\nSo Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film\n\n350\n00:29:53.826 --> 00:29:59.506\nback in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation.\n\n351\n00:29:59.506 --> 00:30:12.948\nHe originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician\n\n352\n00:30:12.948 --> 00:30:19.588\nlike a year prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be\n\n353\n00:30:19.588 --> 00:30:25.908\nBen Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at\n\n354\n00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:31.108\nthis point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look\n\n355\n00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:36.708\nold. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late\n\n356\n00:30:36.708 --> 00:30:41.748\ntwenties. Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly\n\n357\n00:30:41.748 --> 00:30:46.628\nlook like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from\n\n358\n00:30:46.628 --> 00:30:51.828\nwatching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes\n\n359\n00:30:51.828 --> 00:30:57.668\nBen Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much\n\n360\n00:30:57.668 --> 00:31:03.908\nyounger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't\n\n361\n00:31:03.908 --> 00:31:08.468\nreally look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly,\n\n362\n00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:13.268\nand so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter.\n\n363\n00:31:13.268 --> 00:31:17.988\nAlso, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated\n\n364\n00:31:17.988 --> 00:31:22.708\npoorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer\n\n365\n00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:27.108\neraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak.\n\n366\n00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:31.908\nBut the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually\n\n367\n00:31:31.908 --> 00:31:36.628\nfucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage,\n\n368\n00:31:36.628 --> 00:31:42.708\nand makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how\n\n369\n00:31:42.708 --> 00:31:48.388\nexactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely\n\n370\n00:31:48.388 --> 00:31:53.268\nsocially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up\n\n371\n00:31:53.268 --> 00:31:57.188\ngetting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something.\n\n372\n00:31:57.188 --> 00:32:03.628\nEvan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally\n\n373\n00:32:03.628 --> 00:32:10.048\nnot as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on\n\n374\n00:32:10.048 --> 00:32:15.808\nstage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap\n\n375\n00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:21.948\nand finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done\n\n376\n00:32:21.948 --> 00:32:27.868\nand as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid.\n\n377\n00:32:27.868 --> 00:32:34.748\nHe's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt\n\n378\n00:32:34.748 --> 00:32:40.188\non camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are\n\n379\n00:32:40.188 --> 00:32:47.308\nwatching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now\n\n380\n00:32:47.308 --> 00:32:52.988\ndeeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable\n\n381\n00:32:52.988 --> 00:32:58.748\nto us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance\n\n382\n00:32:58.748 --> 00:33:03.628\nsection feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the\n\n383\n00:33:03.628 --> 00:33:08.908\nshow not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought\n\n384\n00:33:08.908 --> 00:33:13.228\nhim this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that\n\n385\n00:33:13.228 --> 00:33:18.828\nwe're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music. And the thing is,\n\n386\n00:33:18.828 --> 00:33:25.468\nthis is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's\n\n387\n00:33:25.468 --> 00:33:30.828\nBroadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors\n\n388\n00:33:30.828 --> 00:33:36.188\nin their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your\n\n389\n00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:41.468\ncasting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is.\n\n390\n00:33:41.468 --> 00:33:46.388\nis. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening\n\n391\n00:33:46.388 --> 00:33:50.848\non stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story.\n\n392\n00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:55.388\nSo this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social\n\n393\n00:33:55.388 --> 00:34:00.428\nmedia posts will pop up throughout the show. This is obviously like a metaphorical representation\n\n394\n00:34:00.428 --> 00:34:05.188\nof social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted\n\n395\n00:34:05.188 --> 00:34:09.268\non a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience,\n\n396\n00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:15.428\nconvey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its\n\n397\n00:34:15.428 --> 00:34:20.388\nfaults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage.\n\n398\n00:34:20.388 --> 00:34:25.908\nThe way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical\n\n399\n00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:31.988\nonlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt,\n\n400\n00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:38.308\nisn't literal. There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton\n\n401\n00:34:38.308 --> 00:34:43.748\nwhen he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space,\n\n402\n00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:48.948\nyou implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things\n\n403\n00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:55.188\nwill act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a\n\n404\n00:34:55.188 --> 00:34:59.988\nrepresentation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much.\n\n405\n00:35:00.548 --> 00:35:05.508\nHalf the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more\n\n406\n00:35:05.508 --> 00:35:11.028\ncomplicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the\n\n407\n00:35:11.028 --> 00:35:16.468\nmetaphorical space of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't\n\n408\n00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:22.068\njust fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and\n\n409\n00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:26.708\npuppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and\n\n410\n00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:31.268\ncostumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like\n\n411\n00:35:31.268 --> 00:35:37.188\na literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized\n\n412\n00:35:37.188 --> 00:35:42.788\nand understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role,\n\n413\n00:35:42.788 --> 00:35:48.628\nit's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping\n\n414\n00:35:48.628 --> 00:35:54.788\ninto the space. The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at\n\n415\n00:35:54.788 --> 00:36:01.108\nlive shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best\n\n416\n00:36:01.108 --> 00:36:14.450\nbest most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a\n\n417\n00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:20.610\nmovie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more\n\n418\n00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:25.490\nliteral representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical,\n\n419\n00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:29.490\nadults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look\n\n420\n00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:35.490\nreally fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close,\n\n421\n00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.490\nand in a much more grounded and realistic setting. So when you're making a movie,\n\n422\n00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:44.130\nwhether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a\n\n423\n00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:49.170\nlot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever\n\n424\n00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:53.650\nyou're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active\n\n425\n00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:58.450\neffort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls\n\n426\n00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:03.410\napart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing\n\n427\n00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:07.730\nsomething like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit,\n\n428\n00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:13.410\nif your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl Streep is obviously\n\n429\n00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:18.130\nan amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods,\n\n430\n00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:23.250\nwhich is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the\n\n431\n00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:28.730\nthe more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette\n\n432\n00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:33.330\nPeters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch\n\n433\n00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:38.490\nlady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed\n\n434\n00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:43.890\nback into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action\n\n435\n00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.630\nfilm just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the\n\n436\n00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:53.370\nfilm with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like\n\n437\n00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:59.650\nvery… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags\n\n438\n00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:04.250\nunder her eyes. She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a\n\n439\n00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.450\nfetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and\n\n440\n00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:12.710\nshe would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout\n\n441\n00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:18.270\nevery scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well,\n\n442\n00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:23.510\nthe differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context\n\n443\n00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:24.730\nof its realism.\n\n444\n00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.590\nIn terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine.\n\n445\n00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.650\nThere were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super\n\n446\n00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:38.830\nin depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor\n\n447\n00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:43.070\nplaying that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women.\n\n448\n00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:47.590\nBut other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their\n\n449\n00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:53.030\njob. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the\n\n450\n00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:58.470\nshow, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are\n\n451\n00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:03.990\nmostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the\n\n452\n00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:11.990\nunfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still\n\n453\n00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:19.750\nhinges on Evan. Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone\n\n454\n00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:25.590\nelse. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this\n\n455\n00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:31.510\nshow comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled\n\n456\n00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:37.030\ninto the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the\n\n457\n00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:42.310\nstory because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen\n\n458\n00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:48.050\nlooks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way\n\n459\n00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.230\nthat we could on stage.\n\n460\n00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.610\nBut even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still\n\n461\n00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:58.850\ncan't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go\n\n462\n00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.570\nbeyond just who is acting in it.\n\n463\n00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:06.810\nAnother really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music,\n\n464\n00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:14.630\nAnd the film unfortunately fucks this up too.\n\n465\n00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:19.070\nSo something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted\n\n466\n00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:23.310\nto film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen.\n\n467\n00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:27.230\nYou are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going\n\n468\n00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.550\nto be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical.\n\n469\n00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:35.250\nSo for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're\n\n470\n00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:39.810\nthe wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations\n\n471\n00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:44.190\nlike Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful\n\n472\n00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.970\nGhosts from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this is just something you're\n\n473\n00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:52.930\ngoing to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always\n\n474\n00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:58.030\nbad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little\n\n475\n00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:02.730\nShop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies'\n\n476\n00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:07.610\nChoice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more\n\n477\n00:41:07.610 --> 00:41:09.210\nof a chance to sing.\n\n478\n00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:15.110\nBut these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical.\n\n479\n00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:18.970\nPart of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the\n\n480\n00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:24.670\nfilms is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song.\n\n481\n00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.910\nWhich you know is fine.\n\n482\n00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.870\nIf they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure.\n\n483\n00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:33.970\nBut it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging\n\n484\n00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:38.710\nthat Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were\n\n485\n00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:43.930\nthese deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like,\n\n486\n00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:44.930\ncome on.\n\n487\n00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.010\nWe all know that that is absolutely never the real reason.\n\n488\n00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:49.010\nIt sucks.\n\n489\n00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:54.170\nBut it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward\n\n490\n00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:58.650\nplaces in the story, and two, the songs being very generic.\n\n491\n00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:01.530\nThat was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman.\n\n492\n00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:20.752\nIt was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of\n\n493\n00:42:20.752 --> 00:42:26.532\nthe context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational\n\n494\n00:42:26.532 --> 00:42:31.512\nand make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the\n\n495\n00:42:31.512 --> 00:42:36.192\ntime when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original\n\n496\n00:42:36.192 --> 00:42:41.532\nmusic, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later.\n\n497\n00:42:41.532 --> 00:42:45.332\nBut in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with\n\n498\n00:42:45.332 --> 00:42:50.252\nAlana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the\n\n499\n00:42:50.252 --> 00:42:54.692\noriginal show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the\n\n500\n00:42:54.692 --> 00:42:59.172\nonly one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we\n\n501\n00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:03.752\ndon't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out\n\n502\n00:43:03.752 --> 00:43:05.252\nin the film's favour.\n\n503\n00:43:05.252 --> 00:43:10.272\nUnfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets\n\n504\n00:43:10.272 --> 00:43:15.132\nin the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental\n\n505\n00:43:15.132 --> 00:43:19.692\nhealth, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea\n\n506\n00:43:19.692 --> 00:43:24.572\nthat lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just\n\n507\n00:43:24.572 --> 00:43:29.132\nthematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't\n\n508\n00:43:29.132 --> 00:43:39.252\nthe only one suffering in this way.\n\n509\n00:43:39.252 --> 00:43:43.972\nIn terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary\n\n510\n00:43:43.972 --> 00:43:48.592\npurpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where\n\n511\n00:43:48.592 --> 00:43:51.312\nwe didn't see much of it in the show.\n\n512\n00:43:51.312 --> 00:43:55.412\nSo in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg\n\n513\n00:43:55.412 --> 00:43:56.412\nplays Alana.\n\n514\n00:43:56.412 --> 00:44:00.392\nI'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was\n\n515\n00:44:00.392 --> 00:44:04.972\nhow they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because\n\n516\n00:44:04.972 --> 00:44:08.852\nit's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film.\n\n517\n00:44:08.852 --> 00:44:13.952\nI'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including\n\n518\n00:44:13.952 --> 00:44:18.552\nones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the\n\n519\n00:44:18.552 --> 00:44:21.692\nmost dour, depressing way possible.\n\n520\n00:44:21.692 --> 00:44:26.092\nEveryone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental\n\n521\n00:44:26.092 --> 00:44:31.372\nhealth, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very\n\n522\n00:44:31.372 --> 00:44:36.412\ndepressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his\n\n523\n00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:40.972\nwords and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film.\n\n524\n00:44:40.972 --> 00:44:52.172\nHe thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair.\n\n525\n00:44:52.172 --> 00:44:52.572\nHe did?\n\n526\n00:44:52.572 --> 00:45:01.892\nHe thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair.\n\n527\n00:45:01.892 --> 00:45:05.352\nBut Alana as a character especially suffers from this.\n\n528\n00:45:05.352 --> 00:45:10.412\nIn the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy.\n\n529\n00:45:10.412 --> 00:45:13.712\nFor the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira.\n\n530\n00:45:13.712 --> 00:45:17.852\nSo what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the\n\n531\n00:45:17.852 --> 00:45:22.672\nshow, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs\n\n532\n00:45:22.672 --> 00:45:27.232\nand achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness.\n\n533\n00:45:27.232 --> 00:45:30.232\nHey, how was your summer?\n\n534\n00:45:30.232 --> 00:45:32.072\nMine was productive.\n\n535\n00:45:32.072 --> 00:45:36.052\nI did three internships and 90 hours of community service.\n\n536\n00:45:36.052 --> 00:45:41.012\nThe idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone\n\n537\n00:45:41.012 --> 00:45:44.752\nlike Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable.\n\n538\n00:45:44.752 --> 00:45:49.592\nBut the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks\n\n539\n00:45:49.592 --> 00:45:53.592\nto Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying\n\n540\n00:45:53.592 --> 00:45:54.592\nto be upbeat.\n\n541\n00:45:54.592 --> 00:45:59.852\nThere's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what\n\n542\n00:45:59.852 --> 00:46:03.892\na depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time\n\n543\n00:46:03.892 --> 00:46:04.892\nshe delivers a line.\n\n544\n00:46:04.892 --> 00:46:05.892\nPhenomenal, really.\n\n545\n00:46:05.892 --> 00:46:09.032\nYou know what's not phenomenal?\n\n546\n00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:10.032\nDeforestation.\n\n547\n00:46:10.032 --> 00:46:16.912\nUm, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications.\n\n548\n00:46:18.352 --> 00:46:23.952\nWell, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June.\n\n549\n00:46:25.552 --> 00:46:26.672\nWe were in school in June.\n\n550\n00:46:26.672 --> 00:46:32.232\nSo for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes,\n\n551\n00:46:32.232 --> 00:46:38.212\nhey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad\n\n552\n00:46:38.212 --> 00:46:43.952\na lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who\n\n553\n00:46:43.952 --> 00:46:49.052\ndelivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing,\n\n554\n00:46:49.252 --> 00:46:53.612\nactually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life\n\n555\n00:46:53.612 --> 00:46:58.712\nand her own struggles because that was missing in the original show. And we do have one of those\n\n556\n00:46:58.712 --> 00:47:03.492\nrare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap\n\n557\n00:47:03.492 --> 00:47:07.012\nin the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty.\n\n558\n00:47:07.012 --> 00:47:11.992\nBut The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story\n\n559\n00:47:11.992 --> 00:47:17.332\nand or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that\n\n560\n00:47:17.332 --> 00:47:19.092\nwere removed in the film.\n\n561\n00:47:19.092 --> 00:47:23.132\nThis is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top\n\n562\n00:47:23.132 --> 00:47:27.572\nof being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend\n\n563\n00:47:27.572 --> 00:47:32.592\nto be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less\n\n564\n00:47:32.592 --> 00:47:36.772\nwithout the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth.\n\n565\n00:47:36.772 --> 00:47:41.812\nSo when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes,\n\n566\n00:47:41.812 --> 00:47:44.752\ncertain songs are just going to have to get cut.\n\n567\n00:47:44.752 --> 00:47:48.732\nOr sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they\n\n568\n00:47:48.732 --> 00:47:53.072\ndo in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably\n\n569\n00:47:53.072 --> 00:47:57.012\nnever should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could\n\n570\n00:47:57.012 --> 00:48:01.852\nhave pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning\n\n571\n00:48:01.852 --> 00:48:06.652\nisn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty. But these things don't just affect\n\n572\n00:48:06.652 --> 00:48:11.932\nthe cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs\n\n573\n00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:11.366\nthat having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally\n\n574\n00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:16.666\nspeaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when\n\n575\n00:24:16.666 --> 00:24:22.666\na song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton,\n\n576\n00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:26.426\nsongs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it\n\n577\n00:24:26.426 --> 00:24:31.966\nbeing you sing when you can no longer speak. These tend to be points of heightened emotion\n\n578\n00:24:31.966 --> 00:24:36.406\nthat are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader\n\n579\n00:24:36.406 --> 00:24:41.766\nstory. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because\n\n580\n00:24:41.766 --> 00:24:47.506\nit sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different\n\n581\n00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:52.466\nperspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about\n\n582\n00:24:52.466 --> 00:24:56.846\nwith one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about\n\n583\n00:24:56.846 --> 00:25:01.266\ntheir complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these\n\n584\n00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:06.806\ncharacters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue. The song is really important,\n\n585\n00:25:06.806 --> 00:25:11.846\nand it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate\n\n586\n00:25:11.846 --> 00:25:16.226\nthat movie. I hate that movie so much. Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source\n\n587\n00:25:16.226 --> 00:25:20.486\nmaterial. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show\n\n588\n00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:25.246\nand just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with\n\n589\n00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:28.126\nthe baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff.\n\n590\n00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:31.406\nSo for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people,\n\n591\n00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:35.326\none of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in\n\n592\n00:25:35.326 --> 00:25:41.006\nanything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive\n\n593\n00:25:41.006 --> 00:25:45.886\nis a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later\n\n594\n00:25:45.886 --> 00:25:51.086\nsee in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other\n\n595\n00:25:51.086 --> 00:25:56.846\npeople and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a\n\n596\n00:25:56.846 --> 00:26:01.806\nDisney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it\n\n597\n00:26:01.806 --> 00:26:07.246\nand then she just leaves. And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death\n\n598\n00:26:07.246 --> 00:26:12.286\nof his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the\n\n599\n00:26:12.286 --> 00:26:18.206\nresponsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father,\n\n600\n00:26:18.206 --> 00:26:23.006\nwho did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle\n\n601\n00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:28.446\nand making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film,\n\n602\n00:26:28.446 --> 00:26:33.086\nby cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing\n\n603\n00:26:33.086 --> 00:26:37.886\nan entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised,\n\n604\n00:26:37.886 --> 00:26:42.206\nand the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children.\n\n605\n00:26:42.206 --> 00:26:44.686\nSo at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like,\n\n606\n00:26:44.686 --> 00:26:49.806\nbe careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like,\n\n607\n00:26:49.806 --> 00:26:54.606\nwhat the fuck are they talking about? What does this have to do with anything we just watched\n\n608\n00:26:54.606 --> 00:26:59.806\nin this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden?\n\n609\n00:26:59.806 --> 00:27:03.806\nThis is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim,\n\n610\n00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:09.006\nwas himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the\n\n611\n00:27:09.006 --> 00:27:14.286\nstory are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods.\n\n612\n00:27:14.286 --> 00:27:20.286\nIn many ways, this theme is the show. My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a\n\n613\n00:27:20.286 --> 00:27:25.806\nnecessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened\n\n614\n00:27:25.806 --> 00:27:30.446\nemotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from\n\n615\n00:27:30.446 --> 00:27:35.006\nthe narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers\n\n616\n00:27:35.006 --> 00:27:39.246\nfrom a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why,\n\n617\n00:27:39.246 --> 00:27:45.886\nand what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that.\n\n618\n00:27:45.886 --> 00:27:51.566\nSo, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad,\n\n619\n00:27:51.566 --> 00:27:57.886\nbonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway.\n\n620\n00:27:57.886 --> 00:28:03.246\nBut they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing,\n\n621\n00:28:03.246 --> 00:28:09.326\nDoes Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the\n\n622\n00:28:09.326 --> 00:28:13.086\nsame time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids.\n\n623\n00:28:22.446 --> 00:28:27.485\nIt serves a few purposes. For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character\n\n624\n00:28:27.485 --> 00:28:32.926\nwhose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom.\n\n625\n00:28:32.926 --> 00:28:37.726\nIt lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like,\n\n626\n00:28:37.726 --> 00:28:42.526\nwhich is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show.\n\n627\n00:28:43.086 --> 00:28:47.726\nIt establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and\n\n628\n00:28:47.726 --> 00:28:52.926\nthe Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes,\n\n629\n00:28:52.926 --> 00:28:57.246\ntheir struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing\n\n630\n00:28:57.246 --> 00:29:02.846\nthe same words at the same time for a reason. And cutting it, instead opening right with\n\n631\n00:29:02.846 --> 00:29:07.406\nEvan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes.\n\n632\n00:29:07.406 --> 00:29:12.486\nAlso, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The\n\n633\n00:29:12.486 --> 00:29:16.646\nI Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because\n\n634\n00:29:16.646 --> 00:29:20.706\ngenerally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a\n\n635\n00:29:20.706 --> 00:29:26.486\nreason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are. You can't\n\n636\n00:29:26.486 --> 00:29:31.606\nI have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who\n\n637\n00:29:31.606 --> 00:29:37.046\nor what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints.\n\n638\n00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:42.246\nJust fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general,\n\n639\n00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:48.566\ncuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem. Because on top of cutting Does\n\n640\n00:29:48.566 --> 00:29:53.846\nAnybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs\n\n641\n00:29:53.846 --> 00:30:15.728\nin the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in\n\n642\n00:30:15.728 --> 00:30:16.728\nhis lies.\n\n643\n00:30:16.728 --> 00:30:21.628\nHe's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone\n\n644\n00:30:21.628 --> 00:30:25.808\nwho is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets\n\n645\n00:30:25.808 --> 00:30:28.208\nfrom it are making him feel good.\n\n646\n00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:30.528\nHis relationship with Zoe is going great.\n\n647\n00:30:30.528 --> 00:30:34.728\nHe keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents,\n\n648\n00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:39.268\nand as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting\n\n649\n00:30:39.268 --> 00:30:44.568\nhis friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother.\n\n650\n00:30:44.568 --> 00:30:48.908\nThe Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his\n\n651\n00:30:48.908 --> 00:30:52.308\nown mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled.\n\n652\n00:30:52.308 --> 00:30:56.768\nAnd Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the\n\n653\n00:30:56.768 --> 00:31:03.248\nlies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the\n\n654\n00:31:03.248 --> 00:31:08.928\nnumber where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him.\n\n655\n00:31:08.928 --> 00:31:14.128\nThey're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable. How he's only being with these\n\n656\n00:31:14.128 --> 00:31:19.008\npeople to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates\n\n657\n00:31:19.008 --> 00:31:24.608\nthe emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be\n\n658\n00:31:24.608 --> 00:31:30.448\ndiscarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the\n\n659\n00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:36.608\nburden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself. The song is important for\n\n660\n00:31:36.608 --> 00:31:41.728\nseveral reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are\n\n661\n00:31:41.728 --> 00:31:47.568\nexplicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are\n\n662\n00:31:47.568 --> 00:31:53.568\naffecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten.\n\n663\n00:31:53.568 --> 00:31:59.088\nThey are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working.\n\n664\n00:31:59.088 --> 00:32:03.328\nThere's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole,\n\n665\n00:32:03.328 --> 00:32:07.888\nand the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again,\n\n666\n00:32:07.888 --> 00:32:12.848\ndeepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists\n\n667\n00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:19.008\nsolely to provide emotional comfort to Evan. It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions.\n\n668\n00:32:19.008 --> 00:32:24.528\nAnd even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story.\n\n669\n00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:30.368\nEven while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a\n\n670\n00:32:30.368 --> 00:32:35.648\nmore sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him,\n\n671\n00:32:35.648 --> 00:32:41.888\nwhere he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real. And to reduce Heidi to a very\n\n672\n00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:47.488\nlimited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with\n\n673\n00:32:47.488 --> 00:32:52.288\nlike a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment.\n\n674\n00:32:52.288 --> 00:32:58.448\nThere's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a\n\n675\n00:32:58.448 --> 00:33:03.248\nsecond because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole,\n\n676\n00:33:03.248 --> 00:33:08.048\nthe way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story,\n\n677\n00:33:08.048 --> 00:33:13.968\nreally acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like\n\n678\n00:33:13.968 --> 00:33:19.888\nwe saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a\n\n679\n00:33:19.888 --> 00:33:24.928\nmusical is fundamentally supposed to do. I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical\n\n680\n00:33:24.928 --> 00:33:30.848\nepisodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that\n\n681\n00:33:30.848 --> 00:33:36.368\nserve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when\n\n682\n00:33:36.368 --> 00:33:41.248\ncutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here.\n\n683\n00:33:41.248 --> 00:33:46.608\nIn terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time,\n\n684\n00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:52.448\nthat adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story. And that's, again,\n\n685\n00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:57.408\njust a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different\n\n686\n00:33:57.408 --> 00:34:02.208\ntime constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new\n\n687\n00:34:02.208 --> 00:34:07.008\ndialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie,\n\n688\n00:34:07.008 --> 00:34:11.808\nor actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy,\n\n689\n00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:16.848\nscripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original,\n\n690\n00:34:16.848 --> 00:34:20.288\nor just things that wouldn't translate well to film.\n\n691\n00:34:20.288 --> 00:34:26.048\nAnd that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of\n\n692\n00:34:26.048 --> 00:34:31.888\ncriticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to\n\n693\n00:34:31.888 --> 00:34:36.928\nreframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage.\n\n694\n00:34:36.928 --> 00:34:43.008\nAnd to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized\n\n695\n00:34:43.008 --> 00:34:49.088\nparts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it.\n\n696\n00:34:54.368 --> 00:34:58.128\nBeyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one,\n\n697\n00:34:58.128 --> 00:35:03.168\nthere are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things,\n\n698\n00:35:03.168 --> 00:35:09.568\nbut really add up. Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend,\n\n699\n00:35:09.568 --> 00:35:16.688\nis made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made,\n\n700\n00:35:16.688 --> 00:35:20.688\nbeyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character.\n\n701\n00:35:20.688 --> 00:35:25.648\nThere is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact\n\n702\n00:35:25.648 --> 00:35:30.608\nthat there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do\n\n703\n00:35:30.608 --> 00:35:34.848\nthink the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled\n\n704\n00:35:34.848 --> 00:35:40.688\ndown to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of\n\n705\n00:35:40.688 --> 00:35:42.848\nactual LGBTQ representation.\n\n706\n00:35:42.848 --> 00:35:46.848\nI rub my nipples and start glowing with delight.\n\n707\n00:35:46.848 --> 00:35:47.808\nHow did you write that?\n\n708\n00:35:49.968 --> 00:35:53.328\nThere's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another.\n\n709\n00:35:53.328 --> 00:35:54.528\nHas been rough.\n\n710\n00:35:54.528 --> 00:36:00.288\nBut not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay.\n\n711\n00:36:00.288 --> 00:36:15.090\nBut not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure\n\n712\n00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:28.450\nGiving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice.\n\n713\n00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:34.530\nThis also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is\n\n714\n00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:40.370\nthe selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over\n\n715\n00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:48.290\nand over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending.\n\n716\n00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:53.410\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like\n\n717\n00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:59.570\nEvan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions.\n\n718\n00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:04.050\nAdditionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor,\n\n719\n00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:09.090\nand instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other\n\n720\n00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:14.370\ncharacters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially\n\n721\n00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:20.290\naddress both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all.\n\n722\n00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:25.410\nSo in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret.\n\n723\n00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:29.810\nNobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens,\n\n724\n00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:35.010\nand Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened.\n\n725\n00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:40.210\nThe film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page.\n\n726\n00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:47.970\nI was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied. Repeatedly.\n\n727\n00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:52.530\nAnd then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages\n\n728\n00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.810\nanyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor,\n\n729\n00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.450\nwho gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic.\n\n730\n00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:07.730\nEvan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people\n\n731\n00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:12.370\ninvolved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the\n\n732\n00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:17.730\nApple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change,\n\n733\n00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:21.890\nbut in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing.\n\n734\n00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:26.930\nPart of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally\n\n735\n00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.930\ndifferent. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone\n\n736\n00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:35.170\nbothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually\n\n737\n00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:41.730\nsee any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into\n\n738\n00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:46.850\nhow this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term.\n\n739\n00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:51.410\nthey simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out\n\n740\n00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:56.610\nas normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change\n\n741\n00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:01.970\nthere not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because\n\n742\n00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:07.330\nthey want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal\n\n743\n00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:13.810\nhimself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to\n\n744\n00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:18.850\nadjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day.\n\n745\n00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:23.010\nShowing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's\n\n746\n00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:27.090\nfavourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call.\n\n747\n00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.650\nEven if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid.\n\n748\n00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:37.970\nBut it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh…\n\n749\n00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:43.210\nSorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic\n\n750\n00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.210\nsong. It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this\n\n751\n00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:53.090\nstandard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon.\n\n752\n00:39:53.090 --> 00:40:04.330\nAnd the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor\n\n753\n00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:10.090\nthan the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film.\n\n754\n00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.730\nAs previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's\n\n755\n00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:19.850\nhome life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality.\n\n756\n00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:25.610\nIt's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like\n\n757\n00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:30.810\nwhile he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around\n\n758\n00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:34.630\nfor the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except\n\n759\n00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.990\nto say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout\n\n760\n00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:44.510\nthe stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him\n\n761\n00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:49.870\non what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab. Because\n\n762\n00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.430\nlike what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first\n\n763\n00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.210\n15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out\n\n764\n00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.330\non stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's. She just\n\n765\n00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:07.530\nfucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the\n\n766\n00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:13.870\nmusical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience. You do that. You do that on stage.\n\n767\n00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:20.530\nClassic difference of mediums. I hit my mic. But in all seriousness, what this means is that even\n\n768\n00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:25.210\nthough we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's\n\n769\n00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:30.210\ninternal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever\n\n770\n00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:35.030\nhe shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This\n\n771\n00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.150\nis the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos.\n\n772\n00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:42.050\nThe movie drops this entirely. I get why.\n\n773\n00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:46.610\nHaving scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to\n\n774\n00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:52.210\nshow on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this\n\n775\n00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.890\nmeans is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely\n\n776\n00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:02.510\nMe, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't\n\n777\n00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:20.592\nreally see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant\n\n778\n00:42:20.592 --> 00:42:25.312\nportion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic\n\n779\n00:42:25.312 --> 00:42:30.352\nacoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't\n\n780\n00:42:30.352 --> 00:42:35.392\nabout Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create\n\n781\n00:42:35.392 --> 00:42:40.672\nmore of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's\n\n782\n00:42:40.672 --> 00:42:46.192\nemotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier.\n\n783\n00:42:46.192 --> 00:42:51.312\nIt makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like\n\n784\n00:42:51.312 --> 00:42:56.432\nthe film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good\n\n785\n00:42:56.432 --> 00:43:02.272\napology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words.\n\n786\n00:43:02.272 --> 00:43:06.512\nThe way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material,\n\n787\n00:43:06.512 --> 00:43:12.032\nwhich already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean\n\n788\n00:43:12.032 --> 00:43:16.912\nand impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty\n\n789\n00:43:16.912 --> 00:43:21.872\ndoesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution\n\n790\n00:43:21.872 --> 00:43:28.272\nand good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing?\n\n791\n00:43:32.832 --> 00:43:37.232\nPerhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones\n\n792\n00:43:37.232 --> 00:43:41.872\nthat you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in\n\n793\n00:43:41.872 --> 00:43:48.112\ngeneral. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form.\n\n794\n00:43:48.112 --> 00:43:53.952\nThings like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face. They're things you can\n\n795\n00:43:53.952 --> 00:43:59.072\neasily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater\n\n796\n00:43:59.072 --> 00:44:04.512\ntheory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is\n\n797\n00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:10.352\nperformed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking\n\n798\n00:44:10.352 --> 00:44:15.472\nand cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying\n\n799\n00:44:15.472 --> 00:44:20.352\nto be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly\n\n800\n00:44:20.352 --> 00:44:24.592\nwhat you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in\n\n801\n00:44:24.592 --> 00:44:30.032\nyour room. It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially\n\n802\n00:44:30.032 --> 00:44:35.392\nrecently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two\n\n803\n00:44:35.392 --> 00:44:40.272\ndifferent mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage\n\n804\n00:44:40.272 --> 00:44:46.832\nwon't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism.\n\n805\n00:44:46.832 --> 00:44:51.792\nIn a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is\n\n806\n00:44:51.792 --> 00:44:56.992\na real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance.\n\n807\n00:44:56.992 --> 00:45:01.712\nYou are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical\n\n808\n00:45:01.712 --> 00:45:03.272\nspace that you do.\n\n809\n00:45:03.272 --> 00:45:07.912\nThat means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess\n\n810\n00:45:07.912 --> 00:45:12.472\nis the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's\n\n811\n00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:17.112\nset is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then.\n\n812\n00:45:17.112 --> 00:45:21.292\nYou can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into\n\n813\n00:45:21.292 --> 00:45:25.132\nanother scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would\n\n814\n00:45:25.132 --> 00:45:30.812\ngive the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage\n\n815\n00:45:30.812 --> 00:45:35.692\nfor the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment.\n\n816\n00:45:35.692 --> 00:45:40.012\nBut I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character\n\n817\n00:45:40.012 --> 00:45:44.812\ninteracts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small\n\n818\n00:45:44.812 --> 00:45:49.612\nmatter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who\n\n819\n00:45:49.612 --> 00:45:55.372\ndon't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set.\n\n820\n00:45:55.372 --> 00:45:59.692\nConsidering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience,\n\n821\n00:45:59.692 --> 00:46:05.212\nrooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life. So a room in a stage show\n\n822\n00:46:05.212 --> 00:46:10.892\nhas a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience.\n\n823\n00:46:10.892 --> 00:46:15.692\nAnd in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception\n\n824\n00:46:15.692 --> 00:46:21.052\nthat this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the\n\n825\n00:46:21.052 --> 00:46:26.252\ncrowd. I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the\n\n826\n00:46:26.252 --> 00:46:31.052\nway a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because\n\n827\n00:46:31.052 --> 00:46:35.132\nof the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to,\n\n828\n00:46:35.132 --> 00:46:40.412\ncould just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business,\n\n829\n00:46:40.412 --> 00:46:45.292\nor sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty\n\n830\n00:46:45.292 --> 00:46:51.212\nbackdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film.\n\n831\n00:46:51.212 --> 00:46:56.652\nNot really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth\n\n832\n00:46:56.652 --> 00:47:02.012\nwall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured.\n\n833\n00:47:02.012 --> 00:47:06.092\nAnd because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is,\n\n834\n00:47:06.092 --> 00:47:11.132\nwe generally expect them to record something matching close to reality. I don't mean that\n\n835\n00:47:11.132 --> 00:47:15.592\nthat we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real\n\n836\n00:47:15.592 --> 00:47:20.892\nlife. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't\n\n837\n00:47:20.892 --> 00:47:22.252\nactually that big.\n\n838\n00:47:22.252 --> 00:47:26.772\nHowever, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists\n\n839\n00:47:26.772 --> 00:47:30.892\nin the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of\n\n840\n00:47:30.892 --> 00:47:35.412\na believable world to us. It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in\n\n841\n00:47:35.412 --> 00:47:39.992\nfilm as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and\n\n842\n00:47:39.992 --> 00:47:45.352\nprops tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre.\n\n843\n00:47:45.352 --> 00:47:50.312\nUnless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark,\n\n844\n00:47:50.312 --> 00:47:54.632\nwhat the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly\n\n845\n00:47:54.632 --> 00:47:59.752\nthe root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical\n\n846\n00:47:59.752 --> 00:48:04.952\nmovies. If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage,\n\n847\n00:48:04.952 --> 00:48:09.512\nit's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards\n\n848\n00:48:09.512 --> 00:48:11.932\nand understandings of how everything should be presented.\n\n849\n00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:11.086\nis… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's\n\n850\n00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:15.406\nespecially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage\n\n851\n00:24:15.406 --> 00:24:19.886\nof time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's\n\n852\n00:24:19.886 --> 00:24:25.086\nlie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create.\n\n853\n00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:30.926\nIt was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents,\n\n854\n00:24:30.926 --> 00:24:35.806\nand then it snowballed out of control from there. And one of the things this show does do well is\n\n855\n00:24:35.806 --> 00:24:41.806\nto convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece,\n\n856\n00:24:41.806 --> 00:24:46.686\nso once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing.\n\n857\n00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:50.766\nEvan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him\n\n858\n00:24:50.766 --> 00:24:55.966\nto keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world\n\n859\n00:24:55.966 --> 00:25:01.166\nmoves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the\n\n860\n00:25:01.166 --> 00:25:07.406\ntemporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family. In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact\n\n861\n00:25:07.406 --> 00:25:13.246\nsame feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him.\n\n862\n00:25:13.246 --> 00:25:18.766\nBut in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just\n\n863\n00:25:18.766 --> 00:25:23.886\nmove around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead,\n\n864\n00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:29.166\nwhen we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more\n\n865\n00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:34.766\ngrounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening\n\n866\n00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:39.726\nto Evan isn't really what we're seeing here. There are long stretches of time between the\n\n867\n00:25:39.726 --> 00:25:45.566\nthings Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really,\n\n868\n00:25:45.566 --> 00:25:50.366\nhe could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes,\n\n869\n00:25:50.366 --> 00:25:54.766\nand along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to\n\n870\n00:25:54.766 --> 00:25:59.806\nrelate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer.\n\n871\n00:25:59.806 --> 00:26:04.846\nThe heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it\n\n872\n00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:10.206\ncan't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it,\n\n873\n00:26:10.206 --> 00:26:14.605\nif you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control,\n\n874\n00:26:14.605 --> 00:26:19.566\nyou need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to\n\n875\n00:26:19.566 --> 00:26:25.006\ntranslate that feeling to a more grounded medium. But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't\n\n876\n00:26:25.006 --> 00:26:29.566\ndo that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we\n\n877\n00:26:29.566 --> 00:26:34.286\nsee him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate\n\n878\n00:26:34.286 --> 00:26:40.206\nmetaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create\n\n879\n00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:46.126\nthe same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism\n\n880\n00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:51.326\ncan actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is\n\n881\n00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:56.446\nThe Last Five Years. For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical\n\n882\n00:26:56.446 --> 00:27:01.566\nmusical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual\n\n883\n00:27:01.566 --> 00:27:08.366\nbreakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety\n\n884\n00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:12.846\nand insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide\n\n885\n00:27:12.846 --> 00:27:16.846\nto her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and…\n\n886\n00:27:17.566 --> 00:27:21.486\nsorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script,\n\n887\n00:27:21.486 --> 00:27:25.726\nI don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out.\n\n888\n00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:30.606\nThe first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective. Jamie's side of the story is told\n\n889\n00:27:30.606 --> 00:27:34.766\nin chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her,\n\n890\n00:27:34.766 --> 00:27:39.166\nwhile Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and\n\n891\n00:27:39.166 --> 00:27:43.486\nending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well,\n\n892\n00:27:43.486 --> 00:27:48.206\nthe fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number\n\n893\n00:27:48.206 --> 00:27:52.926\ntoward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on\n\n894\n00:27:52.926 --> 00:27:58.606\nstage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the\n\n895\n00:27:58.606 --> 00:28:03.166\nactors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other\n\n896\n00:28:03.166 --> 00:28:09.006\nactor comes in to do their song. This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters,\n\n897\n00:28:09.006 --> 00:28:13.406\nit contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the\n\n898\n00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:18.126\nmusical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have\n\n899\n00:28:18.126 --> 00:28:23.006\nlimited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have,\n\n900\n00:28:23.006 --> 00:28:28.526\nand I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics\n\n901\n00:28:28.526 --> 00:28:33.886\nthemselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference\n\n902\n00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:39.086\nin how the two experience things. And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the\n\n903\n00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:44.366\ntwo characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces\n\n904\n00:28:44.366 --> 00:28:49.326\nthe idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time,\n\n905\n00:28:49.326 --> 00:28:54.526\nrather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the\n\n906\n00:28:54.526 --> 00:29:00.686\nlast five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship,\n\n907\n00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:05.966\nyou understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage\n\n908\n00:29:05.966 --> 00:29:11.646\nnot working. I say theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show\n\n909\n00:29:11.646 --> 00:29:16.926\nwhich are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does\n\n910\n00:29:16.926 --> 00:29:22.526\nwork out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting\n\n911\n00:29:22.526 --> 00:29:26.846\nher and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support\n\n912\n00:29:26.846 --> 00:29:32.526\nher and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and\n\n913\n00:29:32.526 --> 00:29:37.246\nmakes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a\n\n914\n00:29:37.246 --> 00:29:42.686\nsuccessful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for\n\n915\n00:29:42.686 --> 00:29:48.126\ntrying to advance his career. It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws\n\n916\n00:29:48.126 --> 00:29:53.726\nand warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out.\n\n917\n00:29:53.726 --> 00:29:59.326\nBut then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film,\n\n918\n00:29:59.326 --> 00:30:15.581\nstarring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did\n\n919\n00:30:15.581 --> 00:30:19.661\nNobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's\n\n920\n00:30:19.661 --> 00:30:25.261\njust piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine.\n\n921\n00:30:25.261 --> 00:30:30.221\nThe camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and\n\n922\n00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:35.101\nperspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy\n\n923\n00:30:35.101 --> 00:30:41.341\nthat you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment.\n\n924\n00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:46.301\nBut yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because\n\n925\n00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:51.661\nof any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again,\n\n926\n00:30:51.661 --> 00:30:57.341\nwe go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with\n\n927\n00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:02.941\nonly two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf.\n\n928\n00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:07.901\nBut that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental,\n\n929\n00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:12.621\nand too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set\n\n930\n00:31:12.621 --> 00:31:17.261\ndesign gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number\n\n931\n00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:23.101\nin it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone.\n\n932\n00:31:23.101 --> 00:31:29.341\nSo because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup.\n\n933\n00:31:29.341 --> 00:31:34.941\nBoth of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras\n\n934\n00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:40.461\nin each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie.\n\n935\n00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:47.261\nThis should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot\n\n936\n00:31:47.261 --> 00:31:52.621\nmore awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of\n\n937\n00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:57.101\nthe songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically,\n\n938\n00:31:57.101 --> 00:32:02.461\nsolos meant to be performed more at air than at living people. And because they're now being\n\n939\n00:32:02.461 --> 00:32:08.061\nperformed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes\n\n940\n00:32:08.061 --> 00:32:13.101\nwhere a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch\n\n941\n00:32:13.101 --> 00:32:18.301\nand try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance\n\n942\n00:32:18.301 --> 00:32:22.781\nit out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly.\n\n943\n00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:27.741\nThe end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a\n\n944\n00:32:27.741 --> 00:32:33.421\nsignificant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play\n\n945\n00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:38.221\nout in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of\n\n946\n00:32:38.221 --> 00:32:42.621\nof the show's impact. It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the\n\n947\n00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:46.921\nway you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is\n\n948\n00:32:46.921 --> 00:32:52.401\na biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more\n\n949\n00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:57.521\nconventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective.\n\n950\n00:32:57.521 --> 00:33:01.281\nIt really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in\n\n951\n00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:05.181\nthe first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather\n\n952\n00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:09.381\njust because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working\n\n953\n00:33:09.381 --> 00:33:14.141\non screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show.\n\n954\n00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:18.521\nAnd honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted\n\n955\n00:33:18.521 --> 00:33:23.381\nto film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with\n\n956\n00:33:23.381 --> 00:33:27.581\nthis. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical,\n\n957\n00:33:27.581 --> 00:33:30.861\nand legit just the direction being overall pretty shit.\n\n958\n00:33:30.861 --> 00:33:36.141\nDear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years.\n\n959\n00:33:36.141 --> 00:33:39.801\nIt follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical.\n\n960\n00:33:39.801 --> 00:33:43.881\nOpening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song,\n\n961\n00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:48.041\nscene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc.\n\n962\n00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:52.381\nThere's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly\n\n963\n00:33:52.381 --> 00:33:55.921\ndifferent than your average Disney musical when you get down to it.\n\n964\n00:33:55.921 --> 00:34:01.181\nSo translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible.\n\n965\n00:34:01.181 --> 00:34:06.381\nBut oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could.\n\n966\n00:34:06.381 --> 00:34:12.161\nThere's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical\n\n967\n00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:17.401\nmovies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it.\n\n968\n00:34:17.401 --> 00:34:21.541\nTom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's\n\n969\n00:34:21.541 --> 00:34:22.541\ncertainly the most notable.\n\n970\n00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:27.921\nFilms in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who\n\n971\n00:34:27.921 --> 00:34:31.941\nwill say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which\n\n972\n00:34:31.941 --> 00:34:33.661\njust… no.\n\n973\n00:34:33.661 --> 00:34:37.541\nLike even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life.\n\n974\n00:34:37.541 --> 00:34:42.361\nThe basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing\n\n975\n00:34:42.361 --> 00:34:43.701\nabout it.\n\n976\n00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:47.541\nSaying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a\n\n977\n00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:51.801\nsubdued opera or a good video game music cover band.\n\n978\n00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:55.501\nIt's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with.\n\n979\n00:34:55.501 --> 00:35:00.521\nAnd yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries.\n\n980\n00:35:00.521 --> 00:35:03.081\nThis isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton.\n\n981\n00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:06.701\nThere's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality.\n\n982\n00:35:06.701 --> 00:35:10.961\nLike I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed\n\n983\n00:35:10.961 --> 00:35:15.261\nby song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern\n\n984\n00:35:15.261 --> 00:35:20.121\nday world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers.\n\n985\n00:35:20.121 --> 00:35:24.661\nBut like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers\n\n986\n00:35:24.661 --> 00:35:28.241\nvia staging and blocking not be… bad.\n\n987\n00:35:28.241 --> 00:35:32.141\nTheoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is\n\n988\n00:35:32.141 --> 00:35:36.021\ngoing to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one.\n\n989\n00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:41.521\nA musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing\n\n990\n00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:42.521\nrhythm.\n\n991\n00:35:42.521 --> 00:35:47.641\nSo okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this.\n\n992\n00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:51.561\nIn the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the\n\n993\n00:35:51.561 --> 00:35:56.141\ndeviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's\n\n994\n00:35:56.141 --> 00:36:01.381\nstoryline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely\n\n995\n00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:16.117\nhate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million\n\n996\n00:36:16.117 --> 00:36:22.117\nshow-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return.\n\n997\n00:36:22.117 --> 00:36:27.797\nSongs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema.\n\n998\n00:36:27.797 --> 00:36:32.757\nCarnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and\n\n999\n00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:37.257\nshow off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch\n\n1000\n00:36:37.257 --> 00:36:42.257\nof citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments\n\n1001\n00:36:42.257 --> 00:36:46.557\neasier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that.\n\n1002\n00:36:46.557 --> 00:36:50.577\nBut that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler\n\n1003\n00:36:50.577 --> 00:36:55.577\nsequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has\n\n1004\n00:36:55.577 --> 00:36:59.357\nto comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie\n\n1005\n00:36:59.357 --> 00:37:04.537\nis just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon\n\n1006\n00:37:04.537 --> 00:37:09.497\nand sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts\n\n1007\n00:37:09.497 --> 00:37:14.657\nthat keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers.\n\n1008\n00:37:14.657 --> 00:37:18.577\nThere's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements\n\n1009\n00:37:18.577 --> 00:37:22.597\nof the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting\n\n1010\n00:37:22.597 --> 00:37:28.517\nbecause the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices.\n\n1011\n00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:33.797\nBut okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen.\n\n1012\n00:37:33.797 --> 00:37:38.457\nI wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird\n\n1013\n00:37:38.457 --> 00:37:41.097\nmannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen.\n\n1014\n00:37:41.097 --> 00:37:45.077\nWith that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In\n\n1015\n00:37:45.077 --> 00:37:48.917\nthe Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song.\n\n1016\n00:37:48.917 --> 00:37:53.817\nBreathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own\n\n1017\n00:37:53.817 --> 00:37:58.317\nanxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming\n\n1018\n00:37:58.317 --> 00:38:03.897\nback home. To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly\n\n1019\n00:38:03.897 --> 00:38:09.497\naimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again,\n\n1020\n00:38:09.497 --> 00:38:13.817\nwe have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The\n\n1021\n00:38:13.817 --> 00:38:17.657\nother people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the\n\n1022\n00:38:17.657 --> 00:38:22.097\ndances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing\n\n1023\n00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:27.437\nyou might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against\n\n1024\n00:38:27.437 --> 00:38:32.877\nNina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result is that despite this number being so\n\n1025\n00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:38.077\ndownbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting\n\n1026\n00:38:38.077 --> 00:38:43.597\nsomething that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music.\n\n1027\n00:38:43.597 --> 00:38:47.357\nNow let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song,\n\n1028\n00:38:47.357 --> 00:38:50.957\nwaving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin?\n\n1029\n00:38:50.957 --> 00:38:55.597\nSo the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare\n\n1030\n00:38:55.597 --> 00:39:00.877\nbecause this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do.\n\n1031\n00:39:00.877 --> 00:39:07.277\nYou see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine. Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room.\n\n1032\n00:39:07.277 --> 00:39:11.997\nIt's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here\n\n1033\n00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:16.957\nthat are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap. I understand what\n\n1034\n00:39:16.957 --> 00:39:21.597\nthey're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like.\n\n1035\n00:39:21.597 --> 00:39:26.877\nBut they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's like you don't even want to be around\n\n1036\n00:39:26.877 --> 00:39:31.117\nwatching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work,\n\n1037\n00:39:31.117 --> 00:39:35.437\nit's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin,\n\n1038\n00:39:35.437 --> 00:39:40.237\nwhich is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once again,\n\n1039\n00:39:40.237 --> 00:39:44.557\nyou have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around\n\n1040\n00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:49.357\nand sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything\n\n1041\n00:39:49.357 --> 00:39:55.277\ncomplex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on.\n\n1042\n00:39:55.277 --> 00:40:00.237\nAnd in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the\n\n1043\n00:40:00.237 --> 00:40:04.557\nkitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the\n\n1044\n00:40:04.557 --> 00:40:09.917\nrefrigerator light. But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the\n\n1045\n00:40:09.917 --> 00:40:15.277\nLes Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death,\n\n1046\n00:40:15.277 --> 00:40:19.917\nShe thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine.\n\n1047\n00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:24.157\nLike the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window,\n\n1048\n00:40:24.157 --> 00:40:28.637\nand then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun.\n\n1049\n00:40:28.637 --> 00:40:33.277\nAnd it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an\n\n1050\n00:40:33.277 --> 00:40:39.837\nactual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children\n\n1051\n00:40:39.837 --> 00:40:44.637\nexcept this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it.\n\n1052\n00:40:44.637 --> 00:40:51.197\nYou are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands.\n\n1053\n00:40:51.197 --> 00:40:55.317\nOnce Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are\n\n1054\n00:40:55.317 --> 00:40:56.317\ndirected.\n\n1055\n00:40:56.317 --> 00:40:59.657\nOnce again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here.\n\n1056\n00:40:59.657 --> 00:41:03.817\nYou see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring\n\n1057\n00:41:03.817 --> 00:41:06.797\nhim and focusing solely on their own lives.\n\n1058\n00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:10.677\nIt's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around\n\n1059\n00:41:10.677 --> 00:41:11.677\nothers.\n\n1060\n00:41:11.677 --> 00:41:16.057\nBut it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with\n\n1061\n00:41:16.057 --> 00:41:19.177\nno real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything.\n\n1062\n00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:23.057\nThey don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they\n\n1063\n00:41:23.057 --> 00:41:27.117\njust gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera.\n\n1064\n00:41:27.117 --> 00:41:31.737\nIt just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song.\n\n1065\n00:41:31.737 --> 00:41:36.017\nAnd it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too\n\n1066\n00:41:36.017 --> 00:41:41.317\non beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc\n\n1067\n00:41:41.317 --> 00:41:45.717\nshot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at.\n\n1068\n00:41:45.717 --> 00:41:52.277\nOnce again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this\n\n1069\n00:41:52.277 --> 00:41:56.837\nis how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going\n\n1070\n00:41:56.837 --> 00:42:03.317\nto look like when not in anxiety mode. It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy\n\n1071\n00:42:03.317 --> 00:42:19.572\nnot actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in\n\n1072\n00:42:19.572 --> 00:42:23.832\nthe same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it.\n\n1073\n00:42:23.832 --> 00:42:27.732\nIt just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it\n\n1074\n00:42:27.732 --> 00:42:31.172\nworse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as\n\n1075\n00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:34.372\nEvan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else.\n\n1076\n00:42:34.372 --> 00:42:39.972\nway that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers\n\n1077\n00:42:39.972 --> 00:42:45.652\nin the film have. Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and\n\n1078\n00:42:45.652 --> 00:42:50.532\nrealistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene,\n\n1079\n00:42:50.532 --> 00:42:54.452\nthe weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it.\n\n1080\n00:42:54.452 --> 00:42:59.172\nDear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to\n\n1081\n00:42:59.172 --> 00:43:03.492\nlook just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers.\n\n1082\n00:43:03.492 --> 00:43:08.772\nIt certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever,\n\n1083\n00:43:08.772 --> 00:43:14.452\nanother Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with\n\n1084\n00:43:14.452 --> 00:43:19.812\nConnor to Connor's family. Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt\n\n1085\n00:43:19.812 --> 00:43:25.092\nbasically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile,\n\n1086\n00:43:25.092 --> 00:43:29.972\nwith maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there.\n\n1087\n00:43:29.972 --> 00:43:33.972\nAnd this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space,\n\n1088\n00:43:33.972 --> 00:43:38.852\nwanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes.\n\n1089\n00:43:38.852 --> 00:43:44.532\nThe stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy\n\n1090\n00:43:44.532 --> 00:43:48.452\nHouse. The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in\n\n1091\n00:43:48.452 --> 00:43:53.252\nsomeone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way\n\n1092\n00:43:53.252 --> 00:43:58.532\ntoo grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels\n\n1093\n00:43:58.532 --> 00:44:03.252\nlike a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable.\n\n1094\n00:44:03.892 --> 00:44:10.852\nThen there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell\n\n1095\n00:44:10.852 --> 00:44:15.652\nHer, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor\n\n1096\n00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:21.012\nactually thought of her. It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is\n\n1097\n00:44:21.012 --> 00:44:25.412\nsupposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented\n\n1098\n00:44:25.412 --> 00:44:30.352\nto Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to\n\n1099\n00:44:30.352 --> 00:44:34.372\nstage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it.\n\n1100\n00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:39.732\nIn the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room,\n\n1101\n00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:43.472\nwhich in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan\n\n1102\n00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:47.532\ngets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing\n\n1103\n00:44:47.532 --> 00:44:52.412\na kiss. It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate\n\n1104\n00:44:52.412 --> 00:44:56.892\nas the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final\n\n1105\n00:44:56.892 --> 00:45:00.892\nmoments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence.\n\n1106\n00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:06.412\nBut then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action\n\n1107\n00:45:06.412 --> 00:45:11.372\nbeing Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen.\n\n1108\n00:45:11.372 --> 00:45:16.732\nAnd like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've\n\n1109\n00:45:16.732 --> 00:45:21.292\nseen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he\n\n1110\n00:45:21.292 --> 00:45:26.732\nwants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out. It makes a song that was mildly\n\n1111\n00:45:26.732 --> 00:45:32.092\ncreepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these\n\n1112\n00:45:32.092 --> 00:45:37.692\nflashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while\n\n1113\n00:45:37.692 --> 00:45:42.732\nsinging about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes.\n\n1114\n00:45:43.372 --> 00:45:48.092\nBoth the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have,\n\n1115\n00:45:48.092 --> 00:45:52.572\nas they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback,\n\n1116\n00:45:52.572 --> 00:45:56.652\nand then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other. The moments where the two sit\n\n1117\n00:45:56.652 --> 00:46:02.172\nbeside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good.\n\n1118\n00:46:02.172 --> 00:46:07.452\nThere's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed\n\n1119\n00:46:07.452 --> 00:46:12.412\nup a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all. Super, super\n\n1120\n00:46:12.412 --> 00:46:16.732\noverkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they\n\n1121\n00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:21.552\nrealized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up\n\n1122\n00:46:21.552 --> 00:46:26.852\nand kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just…\n\n1123\n00:46:26.852 --> 00:46:27.852\nwild to me.\n\n1124\n00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:32.612\nLike, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around. What\n\n1125\n00:46:32.612 --> 00:46:38.252\nwould they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops\n\n1126\n00:46:38.252 --> 00:46:43.372\nhis cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess\n\n1127\n00:46:43.372 --> 00:46:48.572\nup his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe\n\n1128\n00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:53.212\nwhat he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad\n\n1129\n00:46:53.212 --> 00:46:58.492\nemotional scene, I shit you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices\n\n1130\n00:46:58.492 --> 00:47:04.732\npossible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on\n\n1131\n00:47:04.732 --> 00:47:10.492\nshot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes\n\n1132\n00:47:10.492 --> 00:47:15.612\nthat are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no\n\n1133\n00:47:15.612 --> 00:47:19.612\nother interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything.\n\n1134\n00:47:19.612 --> 00:47:24.252\nThis can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the\n\n1135\n00:47:24.252 --> 00:47:29.612\nway they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe\n\n1136\n00:47:29.612 --> 00:47:34.252\nexpressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her\n\n1137\n00:47:34.252 --> 00:47:39.292\ndead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore\n\n1138\n00:47:39.292 --> 00:47:42.052\nor all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird.\n\n1139\n00:47:42.052 --> 00:47:47.092\nAnd the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated\n\n1140\n00:47:47.092 --> 00:47:50.952\nin their own frames, away from each other and across the room.\n\n1141\n00:47:50.952 --> 00:47:54.192\nI'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often.\n\n1142\n00:47:54.192 --> 00:47:57.912\nIf I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to\n\n1143\n00:47:57.912 --> 00:48:02.832\nchoreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option.\n\n1144\n00:48:02.832 --> 00:48:07.292\nBut another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions,\n\n1145\n00:48:07.292 --> 00:48:10.972\nbecause yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every\n\n1146\n00:48:10.972 --> 00:48:11.912\nshot you see on screen is a very good shot.\n\n1147\n00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:11.726\nis putting someone's life at risk. So that's something, and would explain why they really\n\n1148\n00:24:11.726 --> 00:24:15.086\ntry to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames.\n\n1149\n00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:19.726\nThere are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall\n\n1150\n00:24:19.726 --> 00:24:23.966\nnot great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be\n\n1151\n00:24:23.966 --> 00:24:28.926\nthe best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take\n\n1152\n00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:33.246\nshot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers.\n\n1153\n00:24:33.246 --> 00:24:37.406\nIt really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others.\n\n1154\n00:24:37.406 --> 00:24:41.726\nThere's also some bit of cinematography I like. I know I ragged on For Forever,\n\n1155\n00:24:41.726 --> 00:24:46.606\nbut I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window,\n\n1156\n00:24:46.606 --> 00:24:51.406\nConnor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan.\n\n1157\n00:24:51.406 --> 00:24:56.766\nIt shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and\n\n1158\n00:24:56.766 --> 00:25:01.566\ndistant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail,\n\n1159\n00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:05.566\nwhen we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window,\n\n1160\n00:25:05.566 --> 00:25:10.126\nbut this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame,\n\n1161\n00:25:10.126 --> 00:25:14.846\nshowing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid.\n\n1162\n00:25:14.846 --> 00:25:19.726\nIt's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job\n\n1163\n00:25:19.726 --> 00:25:22.606\nexpressing how the characters feel through framing.\n\n1164\n00:25:22.606 --> 00:25:28.606\nAs a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best\n\n1165\n00:25:28.606 --> 00:25:32.686\nelevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the\n\n1166\n00:25:32.686 --> 00:25:37.726\nmusical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall\n\n1167\n00:25:37.726 --> 00:25:42.606\nproblem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard. Part of the problem with doing the\n\n1168\n00:25:42.606 --> 00:25:47.646\nthing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical\n\n1169\n00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:53.086\nacclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie,\n\n1170\n00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:57.006\nis that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel\n\n1171\n00:25:57.006 --> 00:26:01.726\nwill get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best\n\n1172\n00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:06.206\nto ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw.\n\n1173\n00:26:06.206 --> 00:26:10.766\nAnd not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just\n\n1174\n00:26:10.766 --> 00:26:15.966\nsapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of\n\n1175\n00:26:15.966 --> 00:26:22.126\neveryone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want\n\n1176\n00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:25.726\nyou to cry. That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is.\n\n1177\n00:26:52.126 --> 00:27:05.466\nI was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the\n\n1178\n00:27:05.466 --> 00:27:06.586\nentire movie.\n\n1179\n00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:10.466\nThe weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy.\n\n1180\n00:27:10.466 --> 00:27:15.366\nLike, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say,\n\n1181\n00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:18.706\nWorld's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be.\n\n1182\n00:27:18.706 --> 00:27:23.586\nmade sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension.\n\n1183\n00:27:23.586 --> 00:27:29.066\nI mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes\n\n1184\n00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:33.766\nall in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite\n\n1185\n00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:38.226\nthe movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour.\n\n1186\n00:27:38.226 --> 00:27:42.946\nIt's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen\n\n1187\n00:27:42.946 --> 00:27:47.866\nas this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all\n\n1188\n00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:52.906\nin on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the\n\n1189\n00:27:52.906 --> 00:27:57.806\nsong that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed\n\n1190\n00:27:57.806 --> 00:28:03.346\nas a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health. And\n\n1191\n00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:07.906\nevery single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the\n\n1192\n00:28:07.906 --> 00:28:13.906\nstory and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this.\n\n1193\n00:28:13.906 --> 00:28:18.146\nI'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something,\n\n1194\n00:28:18.146 --> 00:28:23.346\nI'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something\n\n1195\n00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:27.506\nemotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing\n\n1196\n00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:32.546\nthe comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless.\n\n1197\n00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:38.546\nbut weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements,\n\n1198\n00:28:38.546 --> 00:28:42.226\nyou're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise.\n\n1199\n00:28:42.226 --> 00:28:47.186\nDear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main\n\n1200\n00:28:47.186 --> 00:28:52.146\ncharacter. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement\n\n1201\n00:28:52.146 --> 00:28:57.666\nof that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands\n\n1202\n00:28:57.666 --> 00:29:02.246\nthe absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing.\n\n1203\n00:29:02.246 --> 00:29:07.586\nAnd more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human. By showing him engaging\n\n1204\n00:29:07.586 --> 00:29:12.226\nin conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments\n\n1205\n00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:16.526\nthat are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show\n\n1206\n00:29:16.526 --> 00:29:21.626\nand see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played\n\n1207\n00:29:21.626 --> 00:29:27.546\nso dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going\n\n1208\n00:29:27.546 --> 00:29:32.826\non. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to\n\n1209\n00:29:32.826 --> 00:29:38.166\nthink about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction\n\n1210\n00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:42.806\nto Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think\n\n1211\n00:29:42.806 --> 00:29:48.306\nabout how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's\n\n1212\n00:29:48.306 --> 00:29:54.046\nsuicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication.\n\n1213\n00:29:54.046 --> 00:29:58.206\nAnd without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going\n\n1214\n00:29:58.206 --> 00:30:15.846\nto drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical\n\n1215\n00:30:15.846 --> 00:30:21.445\nnumbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material\n\n1216\n00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:27.206\nso much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it\n\n1217\n00:30:27.206 --> 00:30:32.486\nmore, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before.\n\n1218\n00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:37.846\nOr at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse.\n\n1219\n00:30:38.406 --> 00:30:43.445\nMusical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work,\n\n1220\n00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:47.445\nlike how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by\n\n1221\n00:30:47.445 --> 00:30:52.326\nchanging the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in\n\n1222\n00:30:52.326 --> 00:30:56.725\nthe real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go,\n\n1223\n00:30:56.725 --> 00:31:01.366\nSaying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche\n\n1224\n00:31:01.366 --> 00:31:06.726\nis as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged.\n\n1225\n00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:11.046\nIt's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage\n\n1226\n00:31:11.046 --> 00:31:16.326\ncounterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even\n\n1227\n00:31:16.326 --> 00:31:21.686\nHairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable\n\n1228\n00:31:21.686 --> 00:31:27.125\nexperiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own,\n\n1229\n00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:31.926\naway from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension. And then you have the bad ones,\n\n1230\n00:31:31.926 --> 00:31:36.486\nthe ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods,\n\n1231\n00:31:36.486 --> 00:31:41.445\nwhich aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of\n\n1232\n00:31:41.445 --> 00:31:47.046\nthe original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films,\n\n1233\n00:31:47.046 --> 00:31:52.165\nunfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these\n\n1234\n00:31:52.165 --> 00:31:57.206\nare the only way that most people can experience them. Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want\n\n1235\n00:31:57.206 --> 00:32:01.445\nto experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording,\n\n1236\n00:32:01.445 --> 00:32:07.686\nyou're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were\n\n1237\n00:32:07.686 --> 00:32:17.766\nother options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a\n\n1238\n00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:22.406\nmusical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time\n\n1239\n00:32:22.406 --> 00:32:26.565\nthat ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off\n\n1240\n00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:31.445\nthe project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom\n\n1241\n00:32:31.445 --> 00:32:37.046\nof the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom movie sucks, well,\n\n1242\n00:32:37.046 --> 00:32:40.566\nSorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance.\n\n1243\n00:32:40.566 --> 00:32:45.765\nHowever, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this. But this increased\n\n1244\n00:32:45.765 --> 00:32:49.765\ndemand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for\n\n1245\n00:32:49.765 --> 00:32:54.886\nthe distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online.\n\n1246\n00:32:54.886 --> 00:32:58.726\nThis dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations.\n\n1247\n00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:03.126\nBefore the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot\n\n1248\n00:33:03.126 --> 00:33:08.246\nharder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just\n\n1249\n00:33:08.246 --> 00:33:13.366\ngoogle that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily. Not that I would condone such a\n\n1250\n00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:18.486\nthing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to\n\n1251\n00:33:18.486 --> 00:33:24.166\nimmortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime\n\n1252\n00:33:24.166 --> 00:33:30.086\ntutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence\n\n1253\n00:33:30.086 --> 00:33:35.166\nin 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only\n\n1254\n00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:38.425\nway for people to consume shows during that time.\n\n1255\n00:33:38.425 --> 00:33:42.326\nAnd I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected\n\n1256\n00:33:42.326 --> 00:33:44.906\nthe way theatre companies viewed bootlegs.\n\n1257\n00:33:44.906 --> 00:33:49.746\nBeforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly\n\n1258\n00:33:49.746 --> 00:33:51.746\nand super easily.\n\n1259\n00:33:51.746 --> 00:33:56.045\nSomeone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know\n\n1260\n00:33:56.045 --> 00:34:01.726\nthe one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown\n\n1261\n00:34:01.726 --> 00:34:07.566\nand Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on\n\n1262\n00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:12.446\nYouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years.\n\n1263\n00:34:12.446 --> 00:34:17.726\nIt definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of\n\n1264\n00:34:17.726 --> 00:34:22.686\nthing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more\n\n1265\n00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:28.686\nshows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera\n\n1266\n00:34:28.686 --> 00:34:33.086\nwon't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's\n\n1267\n00:34:33.086 --> 00:34:38.206\ngoing on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects\n\n1268\n00:34:38.206 --> 00:34:44.285\nare still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching\n\n1269\n00:34:44.285 --> 00:34:51.246\nthe camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation. But if the visuals,\n\n1270\n00:34:51.246 --> 00:34:57.086\nor questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage\n\n1271\n00:34:57.086 --> 00:35:01.805\nversion of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source\n\n1272\n00:35:01.805 --> 00:35:07.006\nthat's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting\n\n1273\n00:35:07.006 --> 00:35:12.446\nrecent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new-\n\n1274\n00:35:12.446 --> 00:35:17.486\nthey've technically been around for a while. But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film\n\n1275\n00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:21.886\nadaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could\n\n1276\n00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:26.766\npotentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were\n\n1277\n00:35:26.766 --> 00:35:31.326\ngenerally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be\n\n1278\n00:35:31.326 --> 00:35:37.165\nopen for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent\n\n1279\n00:35:37.165 --> 00:35:42.766\nand Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Although, pretty much every show has\n\n1280\n00:35:42.766 --> 00:35:47.586\nhas a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just\n\n1281\n00:35:47.586 --> 00:35:52.366\nthat most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact.\n\n1282\n00:35:52.366 --> 00:35:56.526\nThat being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why\n\n1283\n00:35:56.526 --> 00:36:01.366\nyou still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't\n\n1284\n00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:19.605\nreally a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video\n\n1285\n00:36:19.605 --> 00:36:24.406\nstuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts.\n\n1286\n00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:28.726\nAnd it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could\n\n1287\n00:36:28.726 --> 00:36:34.726\nchange though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD\n\n1288\n00:36:34.726 --> 00:36:39.526\nprofessional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the\n\n1289\n00:36:39.526 --> 00:36:43.766\nrecording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public. And sure enough,\n\n1290\n00:36:43.766 --> 00:36:48.886\nthe mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full\n\n1291\n00:36:48.886 --> 00:36:54.485\ntheatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead,\n\n1292\n00:36:54.485 --> 00:37:00.165\nit was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd,\n\n1293\n00:37:00.165 --> 00:37:06.485\n2020. And it was a huge, huge success. Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton,\n\n1294\n00:37:06.485 --> 00:37:10.805\ndiscourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this,\n\n1295\n00:37:10.805 --> 00:37:16.566\nthe Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show.\n\n1296\n00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:20.966\nWhatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton,\n\n1297\n00:37:20.966 --> 00:37:25.846\nyou'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality\n\n1298\n00:37:25.846 --> 00:37:30.886\ninitial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive.\n\n1299\n00:37:30.886 --> 00:37:34.886\nStreaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates,\n\n1300\n00:37:34.886 --> 00:37:40.805\nHamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly\n\n1301\n00:37:40.805 --> 00:37:45.526\nhigh number. It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right\n\n1302\n00:37:45.526 --> 00:37:51.925\nbehind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances,\n\n1303\n00:37:51.925 --> 00:37:57.226\naudiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full\n\n1304\n00:37:57.226 --> 00:38:02.326\nfilm adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place\n\n1305\n00:38:02.326 --> 00:38:06.766\nto distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and\n\n1306\n00:38:06.766 --> 00:38:11.665\nwatch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows\n\n1307\n00:38:11.665 --> 00:38:16.545\nthey're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them. And the demand for such\n\n1308\n00:38:16.545 --> 00:38:21.906\nthings is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will\n\n1309\n00:38:21.906 --> 00:38:27.026\naffect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance\n\n1310\n00:38:27.026 --> 00:38:32.226\nyears before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success.\n\n1311\n00:38:32.226 --> 00:38:37.665\nWe have seen one, though. Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a\n\n1312\n00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:42.785\nfeature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its\n\n1313\n00:38:42.785 --> 00:38:47.665\nappeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of\n\n1314\n00:38:47.665 --> 00:38:52.386\na live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was\n\n1315\n00:38:52.386 --> 00:38:56.946\nimpossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped.\n\n1316\n00:38:56.946 --> 00:39:02.466\nHowever, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film\n\n1317\n00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:07.745\nadaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV.\n\n1318\n00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:12.305\nAnd while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near\n\n1319\n00:39:12.305 --> 00:39:17.106\nas popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a\n\n1320\n00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:21.826\nwatch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material\n\n1321\n00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:26.226\nwould have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole\n\n1322\n00:39:26.226 --> 00:39:31.026\ndebate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather\n\n1323\n00:39:31.026 --> 00:39:36.305\nhave Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal\n\n1324\n00:39:36.305 --> 00:39:41.266\nPictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better\n\n1325\n00:39:41.266 --> 00:39:46.226\nquality product. And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this\n\n1326\n00:39:46.226 --> 00:39:51.106\nis a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future.\n\n1327\n00:39:53.186 --> 00:39:57.266\nDear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that,\n\n1328\n00:39:57.266 --> 00:40:01.745\nespecially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing,\n\n1329\n00:40:01.745 --> 00:40:06.785\nplodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst.\n\n1330\n00:40:06.785 --> 00:40:11.186\nBut as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that\n\n1331\n00:40:11.186 --> 00:40:17.506\nDear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease.\n\n1332\n00:40:17.506 --> 00:40:22.066\nMusical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently.\n\n1333\n00:40:22.066 --> 00:40:26.545\nAfter their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge,\n\n1334\n00:40:26.545 --> 00:40:32.066\nit's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't.\n\n1335\n00:40:32.066 --> 00:40:36.226\nAnd it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films\n\n1336\n00:40:36.226 --> 00:40:42.066\nlike In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan\n\n1337\n00:40:42.066 --> 00:40:46.785\nHansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie\n\n1338\n00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:51.745\nfor real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and\n\n1339\n00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:56.066\ndon't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening\n\n1340\n00:40:56.066 --> 00:40:58.626\ncertainly for real this time, guys.\n\n1341\n00:40:58.626 --> 00:41:02.946\nI went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because\n\n1342\n00:41:02.946 --> 00:41:07.346\nit's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought\n\n1343\n00:41:07.346 --> 00:41:11.866\nabout it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come\n\n1344\n00:41:11.866 --> 00:41:14.565\nfrom a place of hate, but out of love.\n\n1345\n00:41:14.565 --> 00:41:15.565\nI love musicals.\n\n1346\n00:41:15.565 --> 00:41:16.866\nI love them a lot.\n\n1347\n00:41:16.866 --> 00:41:21.065\nI think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain\n\n1348\n00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:22.065\nand enlighten.\n\n1349\n00:41:22.065 --> 00:41:27.266\nIt's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful\n\n1350\n00:41:27.266 --> 00:41:33.106\namalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like\n\n1351\n00:41:33.106 --> 00:41:37.986\na clusterfucked homunculus. During the writing process, after this script had already been\n\n1352\n00:41:37.986 --> 00:41:42.946\nmostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell,\n\n1353\n00:41:42.946 --> 00:41:47.826\njust from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute\n\n1354\n00:41:47.826 --> 00:41:52.885\nfavorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything\n\n1355\n00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:58.226\nabout it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many\n\n1356\n00:41:58.226 --> 00:42:03.206\nof Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love. So much of what he's written has resonated\n\n1357\n00:42:03.206 --> 00:42:18.206\nwith so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible\n\n1358\n00:42:18.206 --> 00:42:22.886\nway of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively\n\n1359\n00:42:22.886 --> 00:42:28.126\nwith other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up\n\n1360\n00:42:28.126 --> 00:42:32.986\nto be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the\n\n1361\n00:42:32.986 --> 00:42:38.746\nsame space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced\n\n1362\n00:42:38.746 --> 00:42:40.166\nin another medium.\n\n1363\n00:42:40.166 --> 00:42:44.346\nWhen you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at\n\n1364\n00:42:44.346 --> 00:42:48.906\nthe same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their\n\n1365\n00:42:48.906 --> 00:42:54.006\nvery discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but\n\n1366\n00:42:54.006 --> 00:42:56.326\nby the fact that it's theatre.\n\n1367\n00:42:56.326 --> 00:43:01.026\nThis was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has\n\n1368\n00:43:01.026 --> 00:43:06.226\nput into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium.\n\n1369\n00:43:06.226 --> 00:43:11.186\nIt's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures\n\n1370\n00:43:11.186 --> 00:43:16.066\nof Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of\n\n1371\n00:43:16.066 --> 00:43:21.346\nHamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we\n\n1372\n00:43:21.346 --> 00:43:26.946\neven get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting\n\n1373\n00:43:26.946 --> 00:43:31.106\non West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's\n\n1374\n00:43:31.106 --> 00:43:33.586\nstill an audience out there for the musical movie.\n\n1375\n00:43:33.586 --> 00:43:38.106\nIt's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the\n\n1376\n00:43:38.106 --> 00:43:42.986\nvideo, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting\n\n1377\n00:43:42.986 --> 00:43:44.986\nthan their stage counterparts.\n\n1378\n00:43:44.986 --> 00:43:49.506\nBut these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is\n\n1379\n00:43:49.506 --> 00:43:53.646\nand what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting\n\n1380\n00:43:53.646 --> 00:43:54.906\npiece of art.\n\n1381\n00:43:54.906 --> 00:43:58.846\nOne of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection\n\n1382\n00:43:58.846 --> 00:44:01.326\nof what makes musicals musicals.\n\n1383\n00:44:01.326 --> 00:44:06.226\nOf strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's\n\n1384\n00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:08.666\nalive and a little bit exaggerated.\n\n1385\n00:44:08.666 --> 00:44:12.326\nAnd as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little\n\n1386\n00:44:12.326 --> 00:44:13.806\nsad to see.\n\n1387\n00:44:13.806 --> 00:44:18.846\nAnd that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing\n\n1388\n00:44:18.846 --> 00:44:23.026\nthe current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that.\n\n1389\n00:44:23.026 --> 00:44:26.786\nIn all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over\n\n1390\n00:44:26.786 --> 00:44:31.426\nthe past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again\n\n1391\n00:44:31.426 --> 00:44:36.306\nhave to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my\n\n1392\n00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:40.626\nfavorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of\n\n1393\n00:44:40.626 --> 00:44:45.346\nstorytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily\n\n1394\n00:44:45.346 --> 00:44:50.466\nexpect. In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case\n\n1395\n00:44:50.466 --> 00:44:54.946\nstudy for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy\n\n1396\n00:44:54.946 --> 00:45:00.466\nDebater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a\n\n1397\n00:45:00.466 --> 00:45:04.946\ncollaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like.\n\n1398\n00:45:04.946 --> 00:45:09.826\nPeople like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice,\n\n1399\n00:45:09.826 --> 00:45:15.666\nor even just recently, my co-writer Emily. For one, it lets us make videos that might not be\n\n1400\n00:45:15.666 --> 00:45:17.406\nbest suited for YouTube.\n\n1401\n00:45:17.406 --> 00:45:21.386\nLike I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which\n\n1402\n00:45:21.386 --> 00:45:24.546\nautomatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization.\n\n1403\n00:45:24.546 --> 00:45:28.026\nWith Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its\n\n1404\n00:45:28.026 --> 00:45:29.346\nway onto YouTube.\n\n1405\n00:45:29.346 --> 00:45:33.266\nSo not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored\n\n1406\n00:45:33.266 --> 00:45:38.086\nsegments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that\n\n1407\n00:45:38.086 --> 00:45:40.386\nyou can only find on that platform.\n\n1408\n00:45:40.386 --> 00:45:44.346\nSo for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning\n\n1409\n00:45:44.346 --> 00:45:49.166\nto become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive\n\n1410\n00:45:49.166 --> 00:45:55.586\nrhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches.\n\n1411\n00:45:55.586 --> 00:46:00.226\nBut you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you\n\n1412\n00:46:00.226 --> 00:46:02.146\nhopefully love.\n\n1413\n00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:07.286\nNebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands\n\n1414\n00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:13.326\nof absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and\n\n1415\n00:46:13.326 --> 00:46:16.446\ntechnology. And it's incredibly cool.\n\n1416\n00:46:16.446 --> 00:46:20.086\nIf you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called\n\n1417\n00:46:20.086 --> 00:46:24.526\nCan a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means\n\n1418\n00:46:24.526 --> 00:46:29.706\nand how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals\n\n1419\n00:46:29.706 --> 00:46:33.366\nand how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really\n\n1420\n00:46:33.366 --> 00:46:38.126\namazing.

Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video, um, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that you're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just giving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a breaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly producing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right? Um, on a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it? So you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking on this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good. Not only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was also just a pretty bad film in its own right. And all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels that have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie. Though out of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is titled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite. But Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been in the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably hearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film adaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting to come to fruition. Both casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that of Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with lots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters start their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even if they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role and just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen. Dear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously bad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to play a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually just looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps happening. We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these embarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations that are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly muted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have you. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just… fascinating. And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking about adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear Evan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the translation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals in general. So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal? So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015. When the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously thinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it. You know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up, and Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who did do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight. So, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be referenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer. I saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything. Evan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins, which is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc. He struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real friends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house, her family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity, and he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles, and prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor. Evan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter on him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their four best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong-armed and interrupted the first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along with the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along He gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him as a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes viral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died. We also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is extremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also either suicidal or just mentally ill in general, and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to hide that fact. In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's family is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up confessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts to repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year later, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and the two of them reflect on all of what happened. The musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number of changes made from the final edition. There was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts and apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut. You can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff like the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call. It was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna be in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same throughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows. One notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of Alana who went through a different actor at every reading. They were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who they wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines through most performances and adaptations of the show. When they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the project. It's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview period- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really wasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead of just dropping the show is extremely funny, though. According to Justin Paul, one of the three people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot take Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they finally had a finished show. And this thing was a huge fucking hit. Dear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety of different reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show, its representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships between all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen and his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people felt that it was able to create. Not only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had the musical up against a number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them, also including Best Musical. Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the show later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all of these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog Day I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of tickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept. But Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically impressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the very least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten. And while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award success and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social media platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise of shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy, or to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only get that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have been friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well, what if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together? So you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen, or just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success and popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had. This has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather got, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community as of late. Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head, I can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their primary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and they tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway. Nowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's, which ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following in two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for so much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning Thief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers and popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness. Shows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly to a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too. This divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever, but usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act politely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like, existing in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them. That critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are, while not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens. Shows like Mean Girls or Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex, relatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a limited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right now and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible tends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation for such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good. So as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans who only like teen musicals thing. That being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter, and the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not liking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical would get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action Beauty and the Beast. Another thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced and started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people would hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume it's a coming out story about a gay kid. I did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this. So when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia page for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family whose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter and also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what the fuck? So there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is a musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible and bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show handles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal with how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately by the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed. Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had a lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like The Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was actually about. And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures of Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school student, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse. So you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question of like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source material poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like, its source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material, and the other is a failure to adapt it correctly. So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good? Both in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about mental health. Eh. It was fine. Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor you see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts grief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done, there are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story. Especially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom. It manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms trying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him, we are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection with his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan with a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son while having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like, social media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come with a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less as their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity. There's a lot to like about this show, and I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window, connected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times, and every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me reconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that. But it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show. There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of the songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important character of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature, but songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good. The show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in their full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it first came out was its depiction of social media. Because like, yeah, we do see that a little. Evan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube. My speech? People started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere. Your speech is everywhere. This morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it. How many does it have now? 4,580. 16,239! He is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and the less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the less likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how we're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment of yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of abusive comments and phone calls online. So it's definitely a present theme in the show, but it's very much only explored on a surface level. We don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean on it sometimes and going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising money, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows him to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared to in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way. There are weird little mental health nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off his meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words, he doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it. And I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad things, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more kind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it. But it does at times struggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense. One of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful, and having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love, and Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't really talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good than bad, which is an interesting message. I don't… really agree with this point about punishment. Mostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see evildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want? He loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part of that family anymore. Do you want him to go to child jail too?",

Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video,\n\n4\n00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.400\num, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that\n\n5\n00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.440\nyou're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just\n\n6\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.940\ngiving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a\n\n7\n00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.600\nbreaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly\n\n8\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:49.020\nproducing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right? Um,\n\n9\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.240\non a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it?\n\n10\n00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.460\nSo you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking\n\n11\n00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.000\non this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical\n\n12\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.600\nDear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good.\n\n13\n00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.440\nNot only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was\n\n14\n00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.660\nalso just a pretty bad film in its own right.\n\n15\n00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.220\nAnd all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels\n\n16\n00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.500\nthat have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie. Though\n\n17\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.320\nout of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is\n\n18\n00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.460\ntitled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite.\n\n19\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.620\nBut Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been\n\n20\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.080\nin the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably\n\n21\n00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.300\nhearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film\n\n22\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.920\nadaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting\n\n23\n00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.580\nto come to fruition.\n\n24\n00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.000\nBoth casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that\n\n25\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.300\nof Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with\n\n26\n00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.700\nlots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters\n\n27\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.080\nstart their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even\n\n28\n00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.140\nif they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role\n\n29\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.660\nand just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen.\n\n30\n00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.300\nDear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously\n\n31\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.140\nbad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to\n\n32\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.540\nplay a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually\n\n33\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.660\njust looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were\n\n34\n00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.620\nTom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps\n\n35\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.540\nhappening. We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these\n\n36\n00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.540\nembarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations\n\n37\n00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.620\nthat are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly\n\n38\n00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.140\nmuted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have\n\n39\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.340\nyou. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just…\n\n40\n00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.220\nfascinating. And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking\n\n41\n00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.100\nabout adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear\n\n42\n00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.540\nEvan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the\n\n43\n00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.140\ntranslation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals\n\n44\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.860\nin general. So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal?\n\n45\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.340\nSo Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015.\n\n46\n00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.820\nWhen the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously\n\n47\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.700\nthinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it.\n\n48\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.579\nYou know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up,\n\n49\n00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.380\nand Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who\n\n50\n00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.180\ndid do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight.\n\n51\n00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.580\nSo, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be\n\n52\n00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.420\nreferenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about,\n\n53\n00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:45.580\nthe show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer.\n\n54\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.220\nI saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything.\n\n55\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.540\nEvan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety,\n\n56\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.500\nand we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins,\n\n57\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.180\nwhich is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc.\n\n58\n00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.980\nHe struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real\n\n59\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.340\nfriends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house,\n\n60\n00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.260\nher family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being\n\n61\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.540\nvery mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity,\n\n62\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.340\nand he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles,\n\n63\n00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.620\nand prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor.\n\n64\n00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.260\nEvan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter\n\n65\n00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.060\non him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their\n\n66\n00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.420\nfour best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong-armed and interrupted\n\n67\n00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.540\nthe first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along\n\n68\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:08.122\nwith the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along\n\n69\n00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:12.262\nHe gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him\n\n70\n00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:17.342\nas a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes\n\n71\n00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:21.102\nviral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died.\n\n72\n00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:25.882\nWe also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is\n\n73\n00:06:25.882 --> 00:06:31.722\nextremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name.\n\n74\n00:06:31.722 --> 00:06:38.442\nHer own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also\n\n75\n00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:44.202\neither suicidal or just mentally ill in general, and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars\n\n76\n00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:49.882\nto hide that fact. In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately\n\n77\n00:06:49.882 --> 00:06:55.482\nhe cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's\n\n78\n00:06:55.482 --> 00:07:00.282\nfamily is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up\n\n79\n00:07:00.282 --> 00:07:05.162\nconfessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with\n\n80\n00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:11.642\nEvan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts\n\n81\n00:07:11.642 --> 00:07:17.082\nto repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year\n\n82\n00:07:17.082 --> 00:07:22.362\nlater, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and\n\n83\n00:07:22.362 --> 00:07:25.822\nthe two of them reflect on all of what happened.\n\n84\n00:07:25.822 --> 00:07:30.022\nThe musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number\n\n85\n00:07:30.022 --> 00:07:32.522\nof changes made from the final edition.\n\n86\n00:07:32.522 --> 00:07:36.662\nThere was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts\n\n87\n00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:40.982\nand apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut.\n\n88\n00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:45.262\nYou can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff\n\n89\n00:07:45.262 --> 00:07:50.942\nlike the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call.\n\n90\n00:07:50.942 --> 00:07:55.302\nIt was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna\n\n91\n00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:59.882\nbe in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same\n\n92\n00:07:59.882 --> 00:08:04.942\nthroughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows.\n\n93\n00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:08.962\nOne notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of\n\n94\n00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:12.482\nAlana who went through a different actor at every reading.\n\n95\n00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:16.482\nThey were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who\n\n96\n00:08:16.482 --> 00:08:22.162\nthey wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines\n\n97\n00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:25.382\nthrough most performances and adaptations of the show.\n\n98\n00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:28.802\nWhen they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly\n\n99\n00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:32.862\nenough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the\n\n100\n00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:33.862\nproject.\n\n101\n00:08:33.862 --> 00:08:37.342\nIt's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview\n\n102\n00:08:37.342 --> 00:08:41.462\nperiod- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really\n\n103\n00:08:41.462 --> 00:08:46.562\nwasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead\n\n104\n00:08:46.562 --> 00:08:51.522\nof just dropping the show is extremely funny, though. According to Justin Paul, one of the\n\n105\n00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:57.982\nthree people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben\n\n106\n00:08:57.982 --> 00:09:02.682\nPlatt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot\n\n107\n00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:08.462\ntake Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive.\n\n108\n00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:13.622\nSo they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they\n\n109\n00:09:13.622 --> 00:09:16.102\nfinally had a finished show.\n\n110\n00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:18.822\nAnd this thing was a huge fucking hit.\n\n111\n00:09:18.822 --> 00:09:24.402\nDear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety\n\n112\n00:09:24.402 --> 00:09:25.862\nof different reasons.\n\n113\n00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:30.942\nThe inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show,\n\n114\n00:09:30.942 --> 00:09:36.002\nits representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships\n\n115\n00:09:36.002 --> 00:09:40.682\nbetween all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen\n\n116\n00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:46.742\nand his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people\n\n117\n00:09:46.742 --> 00:09:48.722\nfelt that it was able to create.\n\n118\n00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:53.342\nNot only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in\n\n119\n00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:58.442\nterms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had\n\n120\n00:09:58.442 --> 00:10:02.242\nthe musical up against a number of other quite good shows.\n\n121\n00:10:02.242 --> 00:10:07.762\nDear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them,\n\n122\n00:10:07.762 --> 00:10:11.902\nalso including Best Musical. Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the\n\n123\n00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:16.602\nshow later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all\n\n124\n00:10:16.602 --> 00:10:22.702\nof these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog\n\n125\n00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:27.082\nDay I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of\n\n126\n00:10:27.082 --> 00:10:32.442\ntickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept.\n\n127\n00:10:32.442 --> 00:10:37.642\nBut Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically\n\n128\n00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:42.522\nimpressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly\n\n129\n00:10:42.522 --> 00:10:48.602\nsimple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the\n\n130\n00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:53.082\nvery least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten.\n\n131\n00:10:53.082 --> 00:10:58.282\nAnd while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award\n\n132\n00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:03.962\nsuccess and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social\n\n133\n00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:09.242\nmedia platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise\n\n134\n00:11:09.242 --> 00:11:15.482\nof shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy,\n\n135\n00:11:15.482 --> 00:11:21.002\nor to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only\n\n136\n00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:26.442\nget that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have\n\n137\n00:11:26.442 --> 00:11:31.242\nbeen friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well,\n\n138\n00:11:31.242 --> 00:11:36.202\nwhat if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together?\n\n139\n00:11:36.202 --> 00:11:41.962\nSo you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen,\n\n140\n00:11:41.962 --> 00:11:47.322\nor just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success\n\n141\n00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:55.322\nand popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had.\n\n142\n00:11:55.322 --> 00:12:13.364\nThis has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather\n\n143\n00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:18.244\ngot, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens\n\n144\n00:12:18.244 --> 00:12:23.204\nor marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community\n\n145\n00:12:23.204 --> 00:12:28.964\nas of late. Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head,\n\n146\n00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:34.564\nI can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their\n\n147\n00:12:34.564 --> 00:12:40.164\nprimary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and\n\n148\n00:12:40.164 --> 00:12:45.204\nthey tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway.\n\n149\n00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:49.524\nNowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's,\n\n150\n00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:54.324\nwhich ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following\n\n151\n00:12:54.324 --> 00:13:00.244\nin two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really\n\n152\n00:13:00.244 --> 00:13:05.764\nexploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for\n\n153\n00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:10.484\nso much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning\n\n154\n00:13:10.484 --> 00:13:16.964\nThief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers\n\n155\n00:13:16.964 --> 00:13:20.964\nand popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness.\n\n156\n00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:26.964\nShows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly\n\n157\n00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:32.644\nto a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too.\n\n158\n00:13:32.644 --> 00:13:37.924\nThis divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever,\n\n159\n00:13:37.924 --> 00:13:43.764\nbut usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act\n\n160\n00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:49.844\npolitely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like,\n\n161\n00:13:49.844 --> 00:13:54.964\nexisting in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them.\n\n162\n00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:58.884\nThat critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are,\n\n163\n00:13:58.884 --> 00:14:06.084\nwhile not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens. Shows like Mean Girls or Be\n\n164\n00:14:06.084 --> 00:14:12.484\nMore Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex,\n\n165\n00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:18.484\nrelatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration,\n\n166\n00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:23.044\nthen, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a\n\n167\n00:14:23.044 --> 00:14:28.964\nlimited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right\n\n168\n00:14:28.964 --> 00:14:35.044\nnow and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting.\n\n169\n00:14:35.044 --> 00:14:40.484\nAt the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible\n\n170\n00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:45.944\ntends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation\n\n171\n00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:51.724\nfor such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people,\n\n172\n00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:56.604\nhonestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good.\n\n173\n00:14:56.604 --> 00:15:02.124\nSo as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway\n\n174\n00:15:02.124 --> 00:15:04.404\nfans who only like teen musicals thing.\n\n175\n00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:09.324\nThat being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter,\n\n176\n00:15:09.324 --> 00:15:13.624\nand the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive\n\n177\n00:15:13.624 --> 00:15:19.864\nmusicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated.\n\n178\n00:15:19.864 --> 00:15:24.324\nDespite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not\n\n179\n00:15:24.324 --> 00:15:28.524\nliking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial\n\n180\n00:15:28.524 --> 00:15:33.804\nand fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical\n\n181\n00:15:33.804 --> 00:15:38.404\nwould get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being\n\n182\n00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:43.464\na Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action\n\n183\n00:15:43.464 --> 00:15:44.724\nBeauty and the Beast.\n\n184\n00:15:44.724 --> 00:15:49.524\nAnother thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced\n\n185\n00:15:49.524 --> 00:15:54.364\nand started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people\n\n186\n00:15:54.364 --> 00:15:59.644\nwould hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because,\n\n187\n00:15:59.644 --> 00:16:03.844\ny'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume\n\n188\n00:16:03.844 --> 00:16:06.064\nit's a coming out story about a gay kid.\n\n189\n00:16:06.064 --> 00:16:11.124\nI did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this.\n\n190\n00:16:11.124 --> 00:16:15.384\nSo when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia\n\n191\n00:16:15.384 --> 00:16:20.564\npage for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family\n\n192\n00:16:20.564 --> 00:16:24.984\nwhose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter\n\n193\n00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:29.304\nand also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be\n\n194\n00:16:29.304 --> 00:16:31.564\nlike, what the fuck?\n\n195\n00:16:31.564 --> 00:16:35.744\nSo there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is\n\n196\n00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:39.904\na musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible\n\n197\n00:16:39.904 --> 00:16:45.564\nand bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show\n\n198\n00:16:45.564 --> 00:16:49.764\nhandles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal\n\n199\n00:16:49.764 --> 00:16:54.504\nwith how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately\n\n200\n00:16:54.504 --> 00:17:01.444\nby the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then\n\n201\n00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:07.084\nwent, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed. Fucked up.\n\n202\n00:17:07.264 --> 00:17:12.464\nSo rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced,\n\n203\n00:17:12.644 --> 00:17:18.124\nincluding Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had\n\n204\n00:17:18.124 --> 00:17:22.664\na lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like\n\n205\n00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:27.644\nThe Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was\n\n206\n00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:33.084\nactually about. And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures\n\n207\n00:17:33.084 --> 00:17:38.204\nof Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school\n\n208\n00:17:38.204 --> 00:17:44.124\nstudent, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying\n\n209\n00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:50.124\nthe upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse.\n\n210\n00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:55.404\nSo you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question\n\n211\n00:17:55.404 --> 00:18:10.706\nof like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source\n\n212\n00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:16.466\nmaterial poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like,\n\n213\n00:18:16.466 --> 00:18:21.666\nits source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material,\n\n214\n00:18:21.666 --> 00:18:28.706\nand the other is a failure to adapt it correctly. So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good?\n\n215\n00:18:28.706 --> 00:18:33.666\nBoth in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about\n\n216\n00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:41.986\nmental health. Eh. It was fine. Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor\n\n217\n00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:47.666\nyou see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts\n\n218\n00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:52.706\ngrief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done,\n\n219\n00:18:52.706 --> 00:18:58.306\nthere are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story.\n\n220\n00:18:58.306 --> 00:19:03.186\nEspecially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom.\n\n221\n00:19:03.186 --> 00:19:08.786\nIt manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms\n\n222\n00:19:08.786 --> 00:19:14.466\ntrying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him,\n\n223\n00:19:14.466 --> 00:19:19.906\nwe are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection\n\n224\n00:19:19.906 --> 00:19:25.026\nwith his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan\n\n225\n00:19:25.026 --> 00:19:30.946\nwith a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son\n\n226\n00:19:30.946 --> 00:19:36.466\nwhile having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like,\n\n227\n00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:40.466\nsocial media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand.\n\n228\n00:19:40.466 --> 00:19:45.506\nI think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come\n\n229\n00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:49.986\nwith a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less\n\n230\n00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:55.266\nas their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize\n\n231\n00:19:55.266 --> 00:20:01.026\nsomething in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity. There's a lot to like about this show,\n\n232\n00:20:01.026 --> 00:20:05.586\nand I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window,\n\n233\n00:20:05.586 --> 00:20:10.626\nconnected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times,\n\n234\n00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:15.586\nand every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me\n\n235\n00:20:15.586 --> 00:20:19.586\nreconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that.\n\n236\n00:20:19.586 --> 00:20:27.186\nBut it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show.\n\n237\n00:20:27.186 --> 00:20:31.986\nThere's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of\n\n238\n00:20:31.986 --> 00:20:37.266\nthe songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important\n\n239\n00:20:37.266 --> 00:20:42.306\ncharacter of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature,\n\n240\n00:20:42.306 --> 00:20:47.746\nbut songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good.\n\n241\n00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:52.226\nThe show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in\n\n242\n00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:56.786\ntheir full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it\n\n243\n00:20:56.786 --> 00:21:02.066\nfirst came out was its depiction of social media. Because like, yeah, we do see that a little.\n\n244\n00:21:02.066 --> 00:21:07.106\nEvan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor\n\n245\n00:21:07.106 --> 00:21:08.786\ngoes viral on YouTube.\n\n246\n00:21:08.786 --> 00:21:09.786\nMy speech?\n\n247\n00:21:09.786 --> 00:21:12.866\nPeople started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere.\n\n248\n00:21:12.866 --> 00:21:14.466\nYour speech is everywhere.\n\n249\n00:21:14.466 --> 00:21:18.786\nThis morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it.\n\n250\n00:21:18.786 --> 00:21:20.226\nHow many does it have now?\n\n251\n00:21:20.226 --> 00:21:21.226\n4,580.\n\n252\n00:21:21.226 --> 00:21:25.166\n16,239!\n\n253\n00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:30.546\nHe is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and\n\n254\n00:21:30.546 --> 00:21:35.386\nthe less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the\n\n255\n00:21:35.386 --> 00:21:40.386\nless likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how\n\n256\n00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:45.426\nwe're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment\n\n257\n00:21:45.426 --> 00:21:51.706\nof yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving\n\n258\n00:21:51.706 --> 00:21:56.786\nfamily is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of\n\n259\n00:21:56.786 --> 00:22:02.146\nabusive comments and phone calls online. So it's definitely a present theme in the\n\n260\n00:22:02.146 --> 00:22:06.626\nshow, but it's very much only explored on a surface level.\n\n261\n00:22:06.626 --> 00:22:11.326\nWe don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean\n\n262\n00:22:11.326 --> 00:22:14.266\non it sometimes and going viral is weird.\n\n263\n00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:18.026\nHis internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising\n\n264\n00:22:18.026 --> 00:22:22.906\nmoney, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows\n\n265\n00:22:22.906 --> 00:22:28.226\nhim to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared\n\n266\n00:22:28.226 --> 00:22:33.906\nto in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure,\n\n267\n00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:39.986\nbut it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way. There are weird little mental\n\n268\n00:22:39.986 --> 00:22:45.106\nhealth nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off\n\n269\n00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:50.226\nhis meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words,\n\n270\n00:22:50.226 --> 00:22:55.106\nhe doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it.\n\n271\n00:22:55.106 --> 00:23:00.066\nAnd I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad\n\n272\n00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:05.106\nthings, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more\n\n273\n00:23:05.106 --> 00:23:10.626\nkind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it. But it does at times\n\n274\n00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:14.946\nstruggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense.\n\n275\n00:23:14.946 --> 00:23:19.986\nOne of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently\n\n276\n00:23:19.986 --> 00:23:25.026\npunished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful,\n\n277\n00:23:25.026 --> 00:23:28.706\nand having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love,\n\n278\n00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:33.986\nand Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't\n\n279\n00:23:33.986 --> 00:23:39.666\nreally talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good\n\n280\n00:23:39.666 --> 00:23:47.106\nthan bad, which is an interesting message. I don't… really agree with this point about punishment.\n\n281\n00:23:47.106 --> 00:23:51.866\nMostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see\n\n282\n00:23:51.866 --> 00:23:57.426\nevildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want?\n\n283\n00:23:57.426 --> 00:24:01.546\nHe loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part\n\n284\n00:24:01.546 --> 00:24:03.286\nof that family anymore.\n\n285\n00:24:03.286 --> 00:24:05.966\nDo you want him to go to child jail too?\n\n",

                        "text": " What? But at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much beaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately. But at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications for others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because of something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible good that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again, there's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can do to a person, and they just don't. And finally, there's the fact that, for all the show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and whatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really more a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story centering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his life are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques is the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by others, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to. But I think the message is weakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor, or to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end up being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly uncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself. And then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work. Alana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing the lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be a suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan. A depressed girl who, instead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending on how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which is largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike Evan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations besides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between either a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles. It's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that Alana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really work. And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show, be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is really… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love it, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either hate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely mid-tier show. One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths, but at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future version of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of those aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut out the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked. And actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out stuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work. So like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is bad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from an adaptational standpoint. Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in general. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's to be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible from the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film is always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie musicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original. But then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen. And there's just so much here that's just really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie. Very much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting, and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild. I will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and that is the fact that James Corden is not in it. Other than that, there's a lot to look at here. So Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film back in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation. He originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician like a year prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be Ben Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at this point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look old. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late twenties. Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly look like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from watching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much younger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter. Also, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer eraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak. But the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually fucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage, and makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how exactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up getting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something. Evan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally not as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on stage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done and as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid. He's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt on camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are watching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable to us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance section feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought him this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that we're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music. And the thing is, this is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's Broadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors in their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your casting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is. is. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening on stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story. So this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social media posts will pop up throughout the show. This is obviously like a metaphorical representation of social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience, convey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its faults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage. The way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt, isn't literal. There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things will act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a representation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much. Half the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more complicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't just fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and costumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like a literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role, it's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping into the space. The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best best most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a movie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more literal representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look really fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close, and in a much more grounded and realistic setting. So when you're making a movie, whether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a lot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever you're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active effort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls apart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit, if your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl Streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods, which is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the the more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed back into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action film just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the film with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like very… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags under her eyes. She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a fetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and she would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout every scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well, the differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context of its realism. In terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine. There were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super in depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor playing that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women. But other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their job. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the unfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still hinges on Evan. Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone else. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this show comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled into the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the story because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen looks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way that we could on stage. But even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still can't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go beyond just who is acting in it. Another really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music, And the film unfortunately fucks this up too. So something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted to film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen. You are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going to be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical. So for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're the wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations like Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful Ghosts from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this is just something you're going to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always bad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies' Choice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more of a chance to sing. But these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical. Part of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the films is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song. Which you know is fine. If they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure. But it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were these deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like, come on. We all know that that is absolutely never the real reason. It sucks. But it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward places in the story, and two, the songs being very generic. That was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of the context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the time when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original music, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later. But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with Alana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the original show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the only one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we don't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out in the film's favour. Unfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental health, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea that lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering in this way. In terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where we didn't see much of it in the show. So in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg plays Alana. I'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was how they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because it's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film. I'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including ones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the most dour, depressing way possible. Everyone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental health, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very depressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film. He thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. He did? He thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. But Alana as a character especially suffers from this. In the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira. So what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs and achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness. Hey, how was your summer? Mine was productive. I did three internships and 90 hours of community service. The idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone like Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable. But the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks to Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really. You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications. Well, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June. We were in school in June. So for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes, hey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad a lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who delivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life and her own struggles because that was missing in the original show. And we do have one of those rare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap in the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story and or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that were removed in the film. This is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top of being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend to be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less without the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth. So when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes, certain songs are just going to have to get cut. Or sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they do in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably never should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could have pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning isn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty. But these things don't just affect the cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs",

Which is a shame because, again,\n\n10\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.840\nthere's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can\n\n11\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.580\ndo to a person, and they just don't. And finally, there's the fact that, for all\n\n12\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.800\nthe show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and\n\n13\n00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.080\nwhatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really\n\n14\n00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.980\nmore a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story\n\n15\n00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.560\ncentering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his\n\n16\n00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.980\nlife are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques\n\n17\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.040\nis the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by\n\n18\n00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.320\nothers, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to. But I think the message is\n\n19\n00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.840\nweakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor,\n\n20\n00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.600\nor to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end\n\n21\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.360\nup being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly\n\n22\n00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.040\nuncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself.\n\n23\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.760\nAnd then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work.\n\n24\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.920\nAlana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing\n\n25\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.040\nthe lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be\n\n26\n00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.360\na suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan. A depressed girl who,\n\n27\n00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.280\ninstead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular\n\n28\n00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.800\npossible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending\n\n29\n00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.660\non how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which\n\n30\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.460\nis largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike\n\n31\n00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.040\nEvan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she\n\n32\n00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.500\ndoesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations\n\n33\n00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.540\nbesides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between\n\n34\n00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.620\neither a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles.\n\n35\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.420\nIt's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that\n\n36\n00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.780\nAlana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really\n\n37\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.140\nwork. And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show,\n\n38\n00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.380\nbe kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is\n\n39\n00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.580\nreally… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love\n\n40\n00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.820\nit, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either\n\n41\n00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.820\nhate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely\n\n42\n00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.780\nmid-tier show. One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths,\n\n43\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.620\nbut at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future\n\n44\n00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.900\nversion of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of\n\n45\n00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.500\nthose aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut\n\n46\n00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:04.100\nout the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked.\n\n47\n00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.820\nAnd actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out\n\n48\n00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.900\nstuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work.\n\n49\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.579\nSo like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is\n\n50\n00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.600\nbad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from\n\n51\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.880\nan adaptational standpoint. Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway\n\n52\n00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.500\nmusical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in\n\n53\n00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.820\ngeneral. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's\n\n54\n00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.220\nto be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible\n\n55\n00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.060\nfrom the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film\n\n56\n00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.660\nis always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie\n\n57\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.220\nmusicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original.\n\n58\n00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.300\nBut then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen. And there's just so much here that's\n\n59\n00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.980\njust really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie.\n\n60\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.660\nVery much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting,\n\n61\n00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.340\nand specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild.\n\n62\n00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.860\nI will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film,\n\n63\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.180\nand that is the fact that James Corden is not in it. Other than that, there's a lot to look at here.\n\n64\n00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:47.860\nSo Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film\n\n65\n00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.540\nback in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation.\n\n66\n00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:06.982\nHe originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician\n\n67\n00:06:06.982 --> 00:06:13.622\nlike a year prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be\n\n68\n00:06:13.622 --> 00:06:19.942\nBen Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at\n\n69\n00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:25.142\nthis point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look\n\n70\n00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:30.742\nold. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late\n\n71\n00:06:30.742 --> 00:06:35.782\ntwenties. Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly\n\n72\n00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:40.662\nlook like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from\n\n73\n00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:45.862\nwatching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes\n\n74\n00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:51.702\nBen Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much\n\n75\n00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:57.942\nyounger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't\n\n76\n00:06:57.942 --> 00:07:02.502\nreally look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly,\n\n77\n00:07:02.502 --> 00:07:07.302\nand so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter.\n\n78\n00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:12.022\nAlso, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated\n\n79\n00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:16.742\npoorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer\n\n80\n00:07:16.742 --> 00:07:21.142\neraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak.\n\n81\n00:07:21.142 --> 00:07:25.942\nBut the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually\n\n82\n00:07:25.942 --> 00:07:30.662\nfucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage,\n\n83\n00:07:30.662 --> 00:07:36.742\nand makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how\n\n84\n00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:42.422\nexactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely\n\n85\n00:07:42.422 --> 00:07:47.302\nsocially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up\n\n86\n00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:51.222\ngetting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something.\n\n87\n00:07:51.222 --> 00:07:57.662\nEvan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally\n\n88\n00:07:57.662 --> 00:08:04.082\nnot as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on\n\n89\n00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:09.842\nstage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap\n\n90\n00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:15.982\nand finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done\n\n91\n00:08:15.982 --> 00:08:21.902\nand as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid.\n\n92\n00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:28.782\nHe's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt\n\n93\n00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:34.222\non camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are\n\n94\n00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:41.342\nwatching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now\n\n95\n00:08:41.342 --> 00:08:47.022\ndeeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable\n\n96\n00:08:47.022 --> 00:08:52.782\nto us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance\n\n97\n00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:57.662\nsection feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the\n\n98\n00:08:57.662 --> 00:09:02.942\nshow not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought\n\n99\n00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:07.262\nhim this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that\n\n100\n00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:12.862\nwe're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music. And the thing is,\n\n101\n00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:19.502\nthis is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's\n\n102\n00:09:19.502 --> 00:09:24.862\nBroadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors\n\n103\n00:09:24.862 --> 00:09:30.222\nin their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your\n\n104\n00:09:30.222 --> 00:09:35.502\ncasting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is.\n\n105\n00:09:35.502 --> 00:09:40.422\nis. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening\n\n106\n00:09:40.422 --> 00:09:44.882\non stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story.\n\n107\n00:09:44.882 --> 00:09:49.422\nSo this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social\n\n108\n00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:54.462\nmedia posts will pop up throughout the show. This is obviously like a metaphorical representation\n\n109\n00:09:54.462 --> 00:09:59.222\nof social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted\n\n110\n00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:03.302\non a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience,\n\n111\n00:10:03.302 --> 00:10:09.462\nconvey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its\n\n112\n00:10:09.462 --> 00:10:14.422\nfaults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage.\n\n113\n00:10:14.422 --> 00:10:19.942\nThe way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical\n\n114\n00:10:19.942 --> 00:10:26.022\nonlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt,\n\n115\n00:10:26.022 --> 00:10:32.342\nisn't literal. There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton\n\n116\n00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:37.782\nwhen he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space,\n\n117\n00:10:37.782 --> 00:10:42.982\nyou implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things\n\n118\n00:10:42.982 --> 00:10:49.222\nwill act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a\n\n119\n00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:54.022\nrepresentation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much.\n\n120\n00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:59.542\nHalf the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more\n\n121\n00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:05.062\ncomplicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the\n\n122\n00:11:05.062 --> 00:11:10.502\nmetaphorical space of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't\n\n123\n00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:16.102\njust fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and\n\n124\n00:11:16.102 --> 00:11:20.742\npuppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and\n\n125\n00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:25.302\ncostumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like\n\n126\n00:11:25.302 --> 00:11:31.222\na literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized\n\n127\n00:11:31.222 --> 00:11:36.822\nand understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role,\n\n128\n00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:42.662\nit's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping\n\n129\n00:11:42.662 --> 00:11:48.822\ninto the space. The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at\n\n130\n00:11:48.822 --> 00:11:55.142\nlive shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best\n\n131\n00:11:55.142 --> 00:12:08.484\nbest most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a\n\n132\n00:12:08.484 --> 00:12:14.644\nmovie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more\n\n133\n00:12:14.644 --> 00:12:19.524\nliteral representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical,\n\n134\n00:12:19.524 --> 00:12:23.524\nadults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look\n\n135\n00:12:23.524 --> 00:12:29.524\nreally fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close,\n\n136\n00:12:29.524 --> 00:12:33.524\nand in a much more grounded and realistic setting. So when you're making a movie,\n\n137\n00:12:33.524 --> 00:12:38.164\nwhether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a\n\n138\n00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:43.204\nlot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever\n\n139\n00:12:43.204 --> 00:12:47.684\nyou're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active\n\n140\n00:12:47.684 --> 00:12:52.484\neffort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls\n\n141\n00:12:52.484 --> 00:12:57.444\napart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing\n\n142\n00:12:57.444 --> 00:13:01.764\nsomething like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit,\n\n143\n00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:07.444\nif your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl Streep is obviously\n\n144\n00:13:07.444 --> 00:13:12.164\nan amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods,\n\n145\n00:13:12.164 --> 00:13:17.284\nwhich is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the\n\n146\n00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:22.764\nthe more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette\n\n147\n00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:27.364\nPeters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch\n\n148\n00:13:27.364 --> 00:13:32.524\nlady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed\n\n149\n00:13:32.524 --> 00:13:37.924\nback into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action\n\n150\n00:13:37.924 --> 00:13:42.664\nfilm just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the\n\n151\n00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:47.404\nfilm with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like\n\n152\n00:13:47.404 --> 00:13:53.684\nvery… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags\n\n153\n00:13:53.684 --> 00:13:58.284\nunder her eyes. She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a\n\n154\n00:13:58.284 --> 00:14:02.484\nfetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and\n\n155\n00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:06.744\nshe would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout\n\n156\n00:14:06.744 --> 00:14:12.304\nevery scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well,\n\n157\n00:14:12.304 --> 00:14:17.544\nthe differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context\n\n158\n00:14:17.544 --> 00:14:18.764\nof its realism.\n\n159\n00:14:18.764 --> 00:14:23.624\nIn terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine.\n\n160\n00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:27.684\nThere were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super\n\n161\n00:14:27.684 --> 00:14:32.864\nin depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor\n\n162\n00:14:32.864 --> 00:14:37.104\nplaying that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women.\n\n163\n00:14:37.104 --> 00:14:41.624\nBut other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their\n\n164\n00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:47.064\njob. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the\n\n165\n00:14:47.064 --> 00:14:52.504\nshow, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are\n\n166\n00:14:52.504 --> 00:14:58.024\nmostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the\n\n167\n00:14:58.024 --> 00:15:06.024\nunfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still\n\n168\n00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:13.784\nhinges on Evan. Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone\n\n169\n00:15:13.784 --> 00:15:19.624\nelse. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this\n\n170\n00:15:19.624 --> 00:15:25.544\nshow comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled\n\n171\n00:15:25.544 --> 00:15:31.064\ninto the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the\n\n172\n00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:36.344\nstory because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen\n\n173\n00:15:36.344 --> 00:15:42.084\nlooks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way\n\n174\n00:15:42.084 --> 00:15:44.264\nthat we could on stage.\n\n175\n00:15:44.264 --> 00:15:48.644\nBut even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still\n\n176\n00:15:48.644 --> 00:15:52.884\ncan't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go\n\n177\n00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:55.604\nbeyond just who is acting in it.\n\n178\n00:15:55.604 --> 00:16:00.844\nAnother really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music,\n\n179\n00:16:00.844 --> 00:16:08.664\nAnd the film unfortunately fucks this up too.\n\n180\n00:16:08.664 --> 00:16:13.104\nSo something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted\n\n181\n00:16:13.104 --> 00:16:17.344\nto film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen.\n\n182\n00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:21.264\nYou are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going\n\n183\n00:16:21.264 --> 00:16:25.584\nto be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical.\n\n184\n00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:29.284\nSo for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're\n\n185\n00:16:29.284 --> 00:16:33.844\nthe wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations\n\n186\n00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:38.224\nlike Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful\n\n187\n00:16:38.224 --> 00:16:42.004\nGhosts from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this is just something you're\n\n188\n00:16:42.004 --> 00:16:46.964\ngoing to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always\n\n189\n00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:52.064\nbad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little\n\n190\n00:16:52.064 --> 00:16:56.764\nShop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies'\n\n191\n00:16:56.764 --> 00:17:01.644\nChoice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more\n\n192\n00:17:01.644 --> 00:17:03.244\nof a chance to sing.\n\n193\n00:17:03.244 --> 00:17:09.144\nBut these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical.\n\n194\n00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:13.004\nPart of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the\n\n195\n00:17:13.004 --> 00:17:18.704\nfilms is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song.\n\n196\n00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:19.944\nWhich you know is fine.\n\n197\n00:17:19.944 --> 00:17:22.904\nIf they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure.\n\n198\n00:17:22.904 --> 00:17:28.004\nBut it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging\n\n199\n00:17:28.004 --> 00:17:32.744\nthat Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were\n\n200\n00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:37.964\nthese deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like,\n\n201\n00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:38.964\ncome on.\n\n202\n00:17:38.964 --> 00:17:42.044\nWe all know that that is absolutely never the real reason.\n\n203\n00:17:42.044 --> 00:17:43.044\nIt sucks.\n\n204\n00:17:43.044 --> 00:17:48.204\nBut it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward\n\n205\n00:17:48.204 --> 00:17:52.684\nplaces in the story, and two, the songs being very generic.\n\n206\n00:17:52.684 --> 00:17:55.564\nThat was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman.\n\n207\n00:17:55.564 --> 00:18:14.786\nIt was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of\n\n208\n00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:20.566\nthe context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational\n\n209\n00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:25.546\nand make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the\n\n210\n00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:30.226\ntime when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original\n\n211\n00:18:30.226 --> 00:18:35.566\nmusic, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later.\n\n212\n00:18:35.566 --> 00:18:39.366\nBut in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with\n\n213\n00:18:39.366 --> 00:18:44.286\nAlana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the\n\n214\n00:18:44.286 --> 00:18:48.726\noriginal show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the\n\n215\n00:18:48.726 --> 00:18:53.206\nonly one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we\n\n216\n00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:57.786\ndon't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out\n\n217\n00:18:57.786 --> 00:18:59.286\nin the film's favour.\n\n218\n00:18:59.286 --> 00:19:04.306\nUnfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets\n\n219\n00:19:04.306 --> 00:19:09.166\nin the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental\n\n220\n00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:13.726\nhealth, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea\n\n221\n00:19:13.726 --> 00:19:18.606\nthat lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just\n\n222\n00:19:18.606 --> 00:19:23.166\nthematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't\n\n223\n00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:33.286\nthe only one suffering in this way.\n\n224\n00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:38.006\nIn terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary\n\n225\n00:19:38.006 --> 00:19:42.626\npurpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where\n\n226\n00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:45.346\nwe didn't see much of it in the show.\n\n227\n00:19:45.346 --> 00:19:49.446\nSo in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg\n\n228\n00:19:49.446 --> 00:19:50.446\nplays Alana.\n\n229\n00:19:50.446 --> 00:19:54.426\nI'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was\n\n230\n00:19:54.426 --> 00:19:59.006\nhow they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because\n\n231\n00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:02.886\nit's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film.\n\n232\n00:20:02.886 --> 00:20:07.986\nI'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including\n\n233\n00:20:07.986 --> 00:20:12.586\nones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the\n\n234\n00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:15.726\nmost dour, depressing way possible.\n\n235\n00:20:15.726 --> 00:20:20.126\nEveryone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental\n\n236\n00:20:20.126 --> 00:20:25.406\nhealth, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very\n\n237\n00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:30.446\ndepressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his\n\n238\n00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:35.006\nwords and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film.\n\n239\n00:20:35.006 --> 00:20:46.206\nHe thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair.\n\n240\n00:20:46.206 --> 00:20:46.606\nHe did?\n\n241\n00:20:46.606 --> 00:20:55.926\nHe thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair.\n\n242\n00:20:55.926 --> 00:20:59.386\nBut Alana as a character especially suffers from this.\n\n243\n00:20:59.386 --> 00:21:04.446\nIn the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy.\n\n244\n00:21:04.446 --> 00:21:07.746\nFor the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira.\n\n245\n00:21:07.746 --> 00:21:11.886\nSo what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the\n\n246\n00:21:11.886 --> 00:21:16.706\nshow, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs\n\n247\n00:21:16.706 --> 00:21:21.266\nand achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness.\n\n248\n00:21:21.266 --> 00:21:24.266\nHey, how was your summer?\n\n249\n00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:26.106\nMine was productive.\n\n250\n00:21:26.106 --> 00:21:30.086\nI did three internships and 90 hours of community service.\n\n251\n00:21:30.086 --> 00:21:35.046\nThe idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone\n\n252\n00:21:35.046 --> 00:21:38.786\nlike Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable.\n\n253\n00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:43.626\nBut the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks\n\n254\n00:21:43.626 --> 00:21:47.626\nto Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying\n\n255\n00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:48.626\nto be upbeat.\n\n256\n00:21:48.626 --> 00:21:53.886\nThere's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what\n\n257\n00:21:53.886 --> 00:21:57.926\na depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time\n\n258\n00:21:57.926 --> 00:21:58.926\nshe delivers a line.\n\n259\n00:21:58.926 --> 00:21:59.926\nPhenomenal, really.\n\n260\n00:21:59.926 --> 00:22:03.066\nYou know what's not phenomenal?\n\n261\n00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:04.066\nDeforestation.\n\n262\n00:22:04.066 --> 00:22:10.946\nUm, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications.\n\n263\n00:22:12.386 --> 00:22:17.986\nWell, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June.\n\n264\n00:22:19.586 --> 00:22:20.706\nWe were in school in June.\n\n265\n00:22:20.706 --> 00:22:26.266\nSo for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes,\n\n266\n00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:32.246\nhey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad\n\n267\n00:22:32.246 --> 00:22:37.986\na lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who\n\n268\n00:22:37.986 --> 00:22:43.086\ndelivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing,\n\n269\n00:22:43.286 --> 00:22:47.646\nactually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life\n\n270\n00:22:47.646 --> 00:22:52.746\nand her own struggles because that was missing in the original show. And we do have one of those\n\n271\n00:22:52.746 --> 00:22:57.526\nrare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap\n\n272\n00:22:57.526 --> 00:23:01.046\nin the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty.\n\n273\n00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:06.026\nBut The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story\n\n274\n00:23:06.026 --> 00:23:11.366\nand or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that\n\n275\n00:23:11.366 --> 00:23:13.126\nwere removed in the film.\n\n276\n00:23:13.126 --> 00:23:17.166\nThis is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top\n\n277\n00:23:17.166 --> 00:23:21.606\nof being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend\n\n278\n00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:26.626\nto be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less\n\n279\n00:23:26.626 --> 00:23:30.806\nwithout the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth.\n\n280\n00:23:30.806 --> 00:23:35.846\nSo when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes,\n\n281\n00:23:35.846 --> 00:23:38.786\ncertain songs are just going to have to get cut.\n\n282\n00:23:38.786 --> 00:23:42.766\nOr sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they\n\n283\n00:23:42.766 --> 00:23:47.106\ndo in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably\n\n284\n00:23:47.106 --> 00:23:51.046\nnever should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could\n\n285\n00:23:51.046 --> 00:23:55.886\nhave pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning\n\n286\n00:23:55.886 --> 00:24:00.686\nisn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty. But these things don't just affect\n\n287\n00:24:00.686 --> 00:24:05.966\nthe cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs\n\n",

                        "text": " that having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally speaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when a song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it being you sing when you can no longer speak. These tend to be points of heightened emotion that are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader story. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because it sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about with one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about their complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these characters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue. The song is really important, and it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate that movie. I hate that movie so much. Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source material. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show and just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with the baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people, one of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in anything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive is a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later see in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other people and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a Disney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it and then she just leaves. And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death of his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the responsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father, who did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle and making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film, by cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised, and the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children. So at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like, be careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like, what the fuck are they talking about? What does this have to do with anything we just watched in this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden? This is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the story are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods. In many ways, this theme is the show. My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a necessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from the narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers from a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why, and what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that. So, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad, bonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway. But they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing, Does Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the same time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids. It serves a few purposes. For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character whose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom. It lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like, which is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show. It establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and the Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes, their struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing the same words at the same time for a reason. And cutting it, instead opening right with Evan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The I Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because generally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a reason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are. You can't I have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who or what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints. Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general, cuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem. Because on top of cutting Does Anybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs in the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone who is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets from it are making him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is going great. He keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents, and as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting his friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother. The Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his own mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled. And Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the lies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the number where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him. They're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable. How he's only being with these people to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates the emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be discarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the burden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself. The song is important for several reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are explicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are affecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten. They are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working. There's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole, and the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again, deepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional comfort to Evan. It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions. And even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him, where he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real. And to reduce Heidi to a very limited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with like a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment. There's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a second because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole, the way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story, really acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like we saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a musical is fundamentally supposed to do. I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical episodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here. In terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time, that adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story. And that's, again, just a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different time constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new dialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie, or actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy, scripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original, or just things that wouldn't translate well to film. And that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of criticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to reframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage. And to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it. Beyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one, there are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but really add up. Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend, is made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made, beyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character. There is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact that there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do think the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled down to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ representation. I rub my nipples and start glowing with delight. How did you write that? There's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another. Has been rough. But not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay. But not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure Giving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice. This also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is the selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over and over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like Evan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions. Additionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor, and instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially address both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all. So in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret. Nobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens, and Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened. The film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page. I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied. Repeatedly. And then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor, who gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic. Evan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the Apple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change, but in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing. Part of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone bothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually see any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into how this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term. they simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change there not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because they want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to adjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's favourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call. Even if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid. But it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh… Sorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic song. It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this standard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon. And the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor than the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film. As previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's home life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality. It's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like while he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around for the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except to say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him on what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab. Because like what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first 15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's. She just fucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the musical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience. You do that. You do that on stage. Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic. But in all seriousness, what this means is that even though we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This is the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos. The movie drops this entirely. I get why. Having scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to show on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this means is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely Me, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't really see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant portion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic acoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create more of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's emotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like the film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good apology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words. The way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material, which already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean and impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution and good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing? Perhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones that you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form. Things like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face. They're things you can easily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater theory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is performed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking and cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying to be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly what you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in your room. It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two different mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage won't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism. In a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is a real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance. You are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical space that you do. That means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess is the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then. You can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into another scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would give the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage for the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment. But I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character interacts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small matter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who don't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set. Considering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience, rooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life. So a room in a stage show has a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience. And in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception that this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the crowd. I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the way a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because of the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to, could just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business, or sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film. Not really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth wall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured. And because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is, we generally expect them to record something matching close to reality. I don't mean that that we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real life. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists in the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of a believable world to us. It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in film as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and props tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre. Unless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, what the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly the root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical movies. If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage, it's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards and understandings of how everything should be presented.",

Generally\n\n2\n00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.700\nspeaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when\n\n3\n00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.700\na song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton,\n\n4\n00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.460\nsongs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it\n\n5\n00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.000\nbeing you sing when you can no longer speak. These tend to be points of heightened emotion\n\n6\n00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.440\nthat are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader\n\n7\n00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.800\nstory. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because\n\n8\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.540\nit sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different\n\n9\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.500\nperspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about\n\n10\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.880\nwith one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about\n\n11\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.300\ntheir complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these\n\n12\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.840\ncharacters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue. The song is really important,\n\n13\n00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.880\nand it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate\n\n14\n00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.260\nthat movie. I hate that movie so much. Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source\n\n15\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.520\nmaterial. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show\n\n16\n00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.280\nand just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with\n\n17\n00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.160\nthe baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff.\n\n18\n00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.440\nSo for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people,\n\n19\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.360\none of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in\n\n20\n00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.040\nanything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive\n\n21\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.920\nis a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later\n\n22\n00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.120\nsee in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other\n\n23\n00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.880\npeople and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a\n\n24\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.840\nDisney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it\n\n25\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.280\nand then she just leaves. And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death\n\n26\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.320\nof his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the\n\n27\n00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.240\nresponsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father,\n\n28\n00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.040\nwho did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle\n\n29\n00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.480\nand making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film,\n\n30\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.120\nby cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing\n\n31\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920\nan entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised,\n\n32\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.240\nand the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children.\n\n33\n00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.720\nSo at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like,\n\n34\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.840\nbe careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like,\n\n35\n00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.640\nwhat the fuck are they talking about? What does this have to do with anything we just watched\n\n36\n00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.840\nin this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden?\n\n37\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.840\nThis is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim,\n\n38\n00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.040\nwas himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the\n\n39\n00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.320\nstory are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods.\n\n40\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.320\nIn many ways, this theme is the show. My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a\n\n41\n00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.840\nnecessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened\n\n42\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.480\nemotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from\n\n43\n00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.040\nthe narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers\n\n44\n00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.280\nfrom a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why,\n\n45\n00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.920\nand what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that.\n\n46\n00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.600\nSo, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad,\n\n47\n00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.920\nbonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway.\n\n48\n00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.280\nBut they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing,\n\n49\n00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.360\nDoes Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the\n\n50\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.120\nsame time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids.\n\n51\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.519\nIt serves a few purposes. For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character\n\n52\n00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.960\nwhose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom.\n\n53\n00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.760\nIt lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like,\n\n54\n00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.560\nwhich is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show.\n\n55\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.760\nIt establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and\n\n56\n00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.960\nthe Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes,\n\n57\n00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.280\ntheir struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing\n\n58\n00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.880\nthe same words at the same time for a reason. And cutting it, instead opening right with\n\n59\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.440\nEvan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes.\n\n60\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.520\nAlso, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The\n\n61\n00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.680\nI Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because\n\n62\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.740\ngenerally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a\n\n63\n00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.520\nreason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are. You can't\n\n64\n00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.640\nI have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who\n\n65\n00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.080\nor what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints.\n\n66\n00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.280\nJust fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general,\n\n67\n00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:42.600\ncuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem. Because on top of cutting Does\n\n68\n00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.880\nAnybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs\n\n69\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:06:09.762\nin the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in\n\n70\n00:06:09.762 --> 00:06:10.762\nhis lies.\n\n71\n00:06:10.762 --> 00:06:15.662\nHe's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone\n\n72\n00:06:15.662 --> 00:06:19.842\nwho is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets\n\n73\n00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:22.242\nfrom it are making him feel good.\n\n74\n00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:24.562\nHis relationship with Zoe is going great.\n\n75\n00:06:24.562 --> 00:06:28.762\nHe keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents,\n\n76\n00:06:28.762 --> 00:06:33.302\nand as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting\n\n77\n00:06:33.302 --> 00:06:38.602\nhis friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother.\n\n78\n00:06:38.602 --> 00:06:42.942\nThe Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his\n\n79\n00:06:42.942 --> 00:06:46.342\nown mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled.\n\n80\n00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:50.802\nAnd Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the\n\n81\n00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:57.282\nlies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the\n\n82\n00:06:57.282 --> 00:07:02.962\nnumber where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him.\n\n83\n00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:08.162\nThey're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable. How he's only being with these\n\n84\n00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:13.042\npeople to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates\n\n85\n00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:18.642\nthe emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be\n\n86\n00:07:18.642 --> 00:07:24.482\ndiscarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the\n\n87\n00:07:24.482 --> 00:07:30.642\nburden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself. The song is important for\n\n88\n00:07:30.642 --> 00:07:35.762\nseveral reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are\n\n89\n00:07:35.762 --> 00:07:41.602\nexplicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are\n\n90\n00:07:41.602 --> 00:07:47.602\naffecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten.\n\n91\n00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:53.122\nThey are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working.\n\n92\n00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:57.362\nThere's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole,\n\n93\n00:07:57.362 --> 00:08:01.922\nand the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again,\n\n94\n00:08:01.922 --> 00:08:06.882\ndeepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists\n\n95\n00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:13.042\nsolely to provide emotional comfort to Evan. It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions.\n\n96\n00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:18.562\nAnd even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story.\n\n97\n00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:24.402\nEven while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a\n\n98\n00:08:24.402 --> 00:08:29.682\nmore sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him,\n\n99\n00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:35.922\nwhere he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real. And to reduce Heidi to a very\n\n100\n00:08:35.922 --> 00:08:41.522\nlimited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with\n\n101\n00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:46.322\nlike a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment.\n\n102\n00:08:46.322 --> 00:08:52.482\nThere's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a\n\n103\n00:08:52.482 --> 00:08:57.282\nsecond because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole,\n\n104\n00:08:57.282 --> 00:09:02.082\nthe way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story,\n\n105\n00:09:02.082 --> 00:09:08.002\nreally acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like\n\n106\n00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:13.922\nwe saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a\n\n107\n00:09:13.922 --> 00:09:18.962\nmusical is fundamentally supposed to do. I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical\n\n108\n00:09:18.962 --> 00:09:24.882\nepisodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that\n\n109\n00:09:24.882 --> 00:09:30.402\nserve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when\n\n110\n00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:35.282\ncutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here.\n\n111\n00:09:35.282 --> 00:09:40.642\nIn terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time,\n\n112\n00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:46.482\nthat adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story. And that's, again,\n\n113\n00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:51.442\njust a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different\n\n114\n00:09:51.442 --> 00:09:56.242\ntime constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new\n\n115\n00:09:56.242 --> 00:10:01.042\ndialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie,\n\n116\n00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:05.842\nor actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy,\n\n117\n00:10:05.842 --> 00:10:10.882\nscripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original,\n\n118\n00:10:10.882 --> 00:10:14.322\nor just things that wouldn't translate well to film.\n\n119\n00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:20.082\nAnd that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of\n\n120\n00:10:20.082 --> 00:10:25.922\ncriticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to\n\n121\n00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:30.962\nreframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage.\n\n122\n00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:37.042\nAnd to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized\n\n123\n00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:43.122\nparts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it.\n\n124\n00:10:48.402 --> 00:10:52.162\nBeyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one,\n\n125\n00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:57.202\nthere are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things,\n\n126\n00:10:57.202 --> 00:11:03.602\nbut really add up. Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend,\n\n127\n00:11:03.602 --> 00:11:10.722\nis made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made,\n\n128\n00:11:10.722 --> 00:11:14.722\nbeyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character.\n\n129\n00:11:14.722 --> 00:11:19.682\nThere is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact\n\n130\n00:11:19.682 --> 00:11:24.642\nthat there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do\n\n131\n00:11:24.642 --> 00:11:28.882\nthink the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled\n\n132\n00:11:28.882 --> 00:11:34.722\ndown to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of\n\n133\n00:11:34.722 --> 00:11:36.882\nactual LGBTQ representation.\n\n134\n00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:40.882\nI rub my nipples and start glowing with delight.\n\n135\n00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:41.842\nHow did you write that?\n\n136\n00:11:44.002 --> 00:11:47.362\nThere's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another.\n\n137\n00:11:47.362 --> 00:11:48.562\nHas been rough.\n\n138\n00:11:48.562 --> 00:11:54.322\nBut not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay.\n\n139\n00:11:54.322 --> 00:12:09.124\nBut not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure\n\n140\n00:12:16.644 --> 00:12:22.484\nGiving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice.\n\n141\n00:12:22.484 --> 00:12:28.564\nThis also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is\n\n142\n00:12:28.564 --> 00:12:34.404\nthe selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over\n\n143\n00:12:34.404 --> 00:12:42.324\nand over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending.\n\n144\n00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:47.444\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like\n\n145\n00:12:47.444 --> 00:12:53.604\nEvan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions.\n\n146\n00:12:53.604 --> 00:12:58.084\nAdditionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor,\n\n147\n00:12:58.084 --> 00:13:03.124\nand instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other\n\n148\n00:13:03.124 --> 00:13:08.404\ncharacters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially\n\n149\n00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:14.324\naddress both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all.\n\n150\n00:13:14.324 --> 00:13:19.444\nSo in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret.\n\n151\n00:13:19.444 --> 00:13:23.844\nNobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens,\n\n152\n00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:29.044\nand Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened.\n\n153\n00:13:29.044 --> 00:13:34.244\nThe film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page.\n\n154\n00:13:35.204 --> 00:13:42.004\nI was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied. Repeatedly.\n\n155\n00:13:42.004 --> 00:13:46.564\nAnd then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages\n\n156\n00:13:46.564 --> 00:13:51.844\nanyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor,\n\n157\n00:13:51.844 --> 00:13:56.484\nwho gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic.\n\n158\n00:13:56.484 --> 00:14:01.764\nEvan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people\n\n159\n00:14:01.764 --> 00:14:06.404\ninvolved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the\n\n160\n00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:11.764\nApple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change,\n\n161\n00:14:11.764 --> 00:14:15.924\nbut in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing.\n\n162\n00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:20.964\nPart of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally\n\n163\n00:14:20.964 --> 00:14:24.964\ndifferent. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone\n\n164\n00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:29.204\nbothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually\n\n165\n00:14:29.204 --> 00:14:35.764\nsee any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into\n\n166\n00:14:35.764 --> 00:14:40.884\nhow this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term.\n\n167\n00:14:40.884 --> 00:14:45.444\nthey simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out\n\n168\n00:14:45.444 --> 00:14:50.644\nas normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change\n\n169\n00:14:50.644 --> 00:14:56.004\nthere not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because\n\n170\n00:14:56.004 --> 00:15:01.364\nthey want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal\n\n171\n00:15:01.364 --> 00:15:07.844\nhimself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to\n\n172\n00:15:07.844 --> 00:15:12.884\nadjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day.\n\n173\n00:15:12.884 --> 00:15:17.044\nShowing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's\n\n174\n00:15:17.044 --> 00:15:21.124\nfavourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call.\n\n175\n00:15:21.124 --> 00:15:25.684\nEven if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid.\n\n176\n00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:32.004\nBut it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh…\n\n177\n00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:37.244\nSorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic\n\n178\n00:15:37.244 --> 00:15:42.244\nsong. It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this\n\n179\n00:15:42.244 --> 00:15:47.124\nstandard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon.\n\n180\n00:15:47.124 --> 00:15:58.364\nAnd the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor\n\n181\n00:15:58.364 --> 00:16:04.124\nthan the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film.\n\n182\n00:16:04.124 --> 00:16:08.764\nAs previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's\n\n183\n00:16:08.764 --> 00:16:13.884\nhome life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality.\n\n184\n00:16:13.884 --> 00:16:19.644\nIt's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like\n\n185\n00:16:19.644 --> 00:16:24.844\nwhile he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around\n\n186\n00:16:24.844 --> 00:16:28.664\nfor the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except\n\n187\n00:16:28.664 --> 00:16:34.024\nto say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout\n\n188\n00:16:34.024 --> 00:16:38.544\nthe stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him\n\n189\n00:16:38.544 --> 00:16:43.904\non what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab. Because\n\n190\n00:16:43.904 --> 00:16:47.464\nlike what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first\n\n191\n00:16:47.464 --> 00:16:52.244\n15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out\n\n192\n00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:57.364\non stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's. She just\n\n193\n00:16:57.364 --> 00:17:01.564\nfucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the\n\n194\n00:17:01.564 --> 00:17:07.904\nmusical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience. You do that. You do that on stage.\n\n195\n00:17:08.624 --> 00:17:14.564\nClassic difference of mediums. I hit my mic. But in all seriousness, what this means is that even\n\n196\n00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:19.244\nthough we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's\n\n197\n00:17:19.244 --> 00:17:24.244\ninternal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever\n\n198\n00:17:24.244 --> 00:17:29.064\nhe shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This\n\n199\n00:17:29.064 --> 00:17:33.184\nis the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos.\n\n200\n00:17:33.184 --> 00:17:36.084\nThe movie drops this entirely. I get why.\n\n201\n00:17:36.084 --> 00:17:40.644\nHaving scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to\n\n202\n00:17:40.644 --> 00:17:46.244\nshow on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this\n\n203\n00:17:46.244 --> 00:17:50.924\nmeans is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely\n\n204\n00:17:50.924 --> 00:17:56.544\nMe, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't\n\n205\n00:17:56.544 --> 00:18:14.626\nreally see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant\n\n206\n00:18:14.626 --> 00:18:19.346\nportion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic\n\n207\n00:18:19.346 --> 00:18:24.386\nacoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't\n\n208\n00:18:24.386 --> 00:18:29.426\nabout Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create\n\n209\n00:18:29.426 --> 00:18:34.706\nmore of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's\n\n210\n00:18:34.706 --> 00:18:40.226\nemotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier.\n\n211\n00:18:40.226 --> 00:18:45.346\nIt makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like\n\n212\n00:18:45.346 --> 00:18:50.466\nthe film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good\n\n213\n00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:56.306\napology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words.\n\n214\n00:18:56.306 --> 00:19:00.546\nThe way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material,\n\n215\n00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:06.066\nwhich already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean\n\n216\n00:19:06.066 --> 00:19:10.946\nand impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty\n\n217\n00:19:10.946 --> 00:19:15.906\ndoesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution\n\n218\n00:19:15.906 --> 00:19:22.306\nand good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing?\n\n219\n00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:31.266\nPerhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones\n\n220\n00:19:31.266 --> 00:19:35.906\nthat you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in\n\n221\n00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:42.146\ngeneral. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form.\n\n222\n00:19:42.146 --> 00:19:47.986\nThings like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face. They're things you can\n\n223\n00:19:47.986 --> 00:19:53.106\neasily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater\n\n224\n00:19:53.106 --> 00:19:58.546\ntheory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is\n\n225\n00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:04.386\nperformed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking\n\n226\n00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:09.506\nand cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying\n\n227\n00:20:09.506 --> 00:20:14.386\nto be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly\n\n228\n00:20:14.386 --> 00:20:18.626\nwhat you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in\n\n229\n00:20:18.626 --> 00:20:24.066\nyour room. It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially\n\n230\n00:20:24.066 --> 00:20:29.426\nrecently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two\n\n231\n00:20:29.426 --> 00:20:34.306\ndifferent mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage\n\n232\n00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:40.866\nwon't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism.\n\n233\n00:20:40.866 --> 00:20:45.826\nIn a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is\n\n234\n00:20:45.826 --> 00:20:51.026\na real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance.\n\n235\n00:20:51.026 --> 00:20:55.746\nYou are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical\n\n236\n00:20:55.746 --> 00:20:57.306\nspace that you do.\n\n237\n00:20:57.306 --> 00:21:01.946\nThat means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess\n\n238\n00:21:01.946 --> 00:21:06.506\nis the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's\n\n239\n00:21:06.506 --> 00:21:11.146\nset is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then.\n\n240\n00:21:11.146 --> 00:21:15.326\nYou can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into\n\n241\n00:21:15.326 --> 00:21:19.166\nanother scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would\n\n242\n00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:24.846\ngive the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage\n\n243\n00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:29.726\nfor the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment.\n\n244\n00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:34.046\nBut I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character\n\n245\n00:21:34.046 --> 00:21:38.846\ninteracts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small\n\n246\n00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:43.646\nmatter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who\n\n247\n00:21:43.646 --> 00:21:49.406\ndon't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set.\n\n248\n00:21:49.406 --> 00:21:53.726\nConsidering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience,\n\n249\n00:21:53.726 --> 00:21:59.246\nrooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life. So a room in a stage show\n\n250\n00:21:59.246 --> 00:22:04.926\nhas a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience.\n\n251\n00:22:04.926 --> 00:22:09.726\nAnd in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception\n\n252\n00:22:09.726 --> 00:22:15.086\nthat this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the\n\n253\n00:22:15.086 --> 00:22:20.286\ncrowd. I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the\n\n254\n00:22:20.286 --> 00:22:25.086\nway a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because\n\n255\n00:22:25.086 --> 00:22:29.166\nof the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to,\n\n256\n00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:34.446\ncould just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business,\n\n257\n00:22:34.446 --> 00:22:39.326\nor sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty\n\n258\n00:22:39.326 --> 00:22:45.246\nbackdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film.\n\n259\n00:22:45.246 --> 00:22:50.686\nNot really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth\n\n260\n00:22:50.686 --> 00:22:56.046\nwall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured.\n\n261\n00:22:56.046 --> 00:23:00.126\nAnd because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is,\n\n262\n00:23:00.126 --> 00:23:05.166\nwe generally expect them to record something matching close to reality. I don't mean that\n\n263\n00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:09.626\nthat we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real\n\n264\n00:23:09.626 --> 00:23:14.926\nlife. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't\n\n265\n00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.286\nactually that big.\n\n266\n00:23:16.286 --> 00:23:20.806\nHowever, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists\n\n267\n00:23:20.806 --> 00:23:24.926\nin the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of\n\n268\n00:23:24.926 --> 00:23:29.446\na believable world to us. It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in\n\n269\n00:23:29.446 --> 00:23:34.026\nfilm as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and\n\n270\n00:23:34.026 --> 00:23:39.386\nprops tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre.\n\n271\n00:23:39.386 --> 00:23:44.346\nUnless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark,\n\n272\n00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:48.666\nwhat the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly\n\n273\n00:23:48.666 --> 00:23:53.786\nthe root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical\n\n274\n00:23:53.786 --> 00:23:58.986\nmovies. If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage,\n\n275\n00:23:58.986 --> 00:24:03.546\nit's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards\n\n276\n00:24:03.546 --> 00:24:05.966\nand understandings of how everything should be presented.\n\n",

                        "text": " is… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's especially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage of time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create. It was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents, and then it snowballed out of control from there. And one of the things this show does do well is to convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing. Evan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world moves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the temporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family. In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact same feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him. But in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just move around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more grounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't really what we're seeing here. There are long stretches of time between the things Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really, he could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes, and along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to relate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer. The heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it can't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it, if you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control, you need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to translate that feeling to a more grounded medium. But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't do that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we see him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create the same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism can actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is The Last Five Years. For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical musical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual breakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety and insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide to her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and… sorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script, I don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out. The first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective. Jamie's side of the story is told in chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her, while Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and ending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well, the fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number toward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on stage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the actors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other actor comes in to do their song. This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have limited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have, and I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference in how the two experience things. And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the two characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces the idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time, rather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the last five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship, you understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage not working. I say theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show which are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support her and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a successful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for trying to advance his career. It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out. But then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did Nobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine. The camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and perspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy that you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment. But yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because of any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again, we go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with only two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf. But that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental, and too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set design gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number in it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone. So because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup. Both of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras in each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie. This should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot more awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of the songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically, solos meant to be performed more at air than at living people. And because they're now being performed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch and try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance it out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly. The end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play out in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of of the show's impact. It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the way you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective. It really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in the first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather just because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working on screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show. And honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted to film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with this. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical, and legit just the direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years. It follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song, scene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc. There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly different than your average Disney musical when you get down to it. So translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible. But oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could. There's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's certainly the most notable. Films in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who will say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which just… no. Like even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing about it. Saying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a subdued opera or a good video game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with. And yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed by song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern day world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers. But like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers via staging and blocking not be… bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is going to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one. A musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm. So okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this. In the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the deviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely hate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million show-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return. Songs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema. Carnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and show off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments easier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that. But that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler sequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has to comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie is just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon and sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts that keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting because the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices. But okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In the Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song. Breathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own anxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming back home. To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again, we have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The other people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the dances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing you might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result is that despite this number being so downbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting something that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music. Now let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song, waving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin? So the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare because this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do. You see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine. Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room. It's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap. I understand what they're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like. But they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's like you don't even want to be around watching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work, it's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin, which is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once again, you have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around and sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything complex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on. And in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the refrigerator light. But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the Les Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death, She thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine. Like the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window, and then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun. And it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an actual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children except this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it. You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands. Once Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are directed. Once again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here. You see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him and focusing solely on their own lives. It's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around others. But it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with no real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they just gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song. And it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too on beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at. Once again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this is how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going to look like when not in anxiety mode. It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy not actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in the same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it. It just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as Evan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else. way that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers in the film have. Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and realistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene, the weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it. Dear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to look just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers. It certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever, another Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with Connor to Connor's family. Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt basically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there. And this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space, wanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes. The stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy House. The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way too grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels like a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor actually thought of her. It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is supposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented to Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to stage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it. In the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room, which in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan gets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing a kiss. It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate as the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final moments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action being Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen. And like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've seen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he wants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out. It makes a song that was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these flashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while singing about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have, as they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other. The moments where the two sit beside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good. There's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed up a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all. Super, super overkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they realized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up and kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just… wild to me. Like, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around. What would they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops his cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess up his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe what he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad emotional scene, I shit you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices possible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on shot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes that are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no other interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything. This can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the way they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore or all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird. And the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated in their own frames, away from each other and across the room. I'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often. If I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option. But another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions, because yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every shot you see on screen is a very good shot.",

                        "vtt": "1\n00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120\nis… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's\n\n2\n00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.440\nespecially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage\n\n3\n00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.920\nof time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's\n\n4\n00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.120\nlie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create.\n\n5\n00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.960\nIt was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents,\n\n6\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.840\nand then it snowballed out of control from there. And one of the things this show does do well is\n\n7\n00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.840\nto convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece,\n\n8\n00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.720\nso once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing.\n\n9\n00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800\nEvan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him\n\n10\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.000\nto keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world\n\n11\n00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.200\nmoves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the\n\n12\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.440\ntemporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family. In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact\n\n13\n00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.280\nsame feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him.\n\n14\n00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.800\nBut in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just\n\n15\n00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.920\nmove around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead,\n\n16\n00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.200\nwhen we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more\n\n17\n00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.800\ngrounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening\n\n18\n00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.760\nto Evan isn't really what we're seeing here. There are long stretches of time between the\n\n19\n00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.600\nthings Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really,\n\n20\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.400\nhe could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes,\n\n21\n00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.800\nand along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to\n\n22\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.840\nrelate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer.\n\n23\n00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.880\nThe heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it\n\n24\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.240\ncan't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it,\n\n25\n00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.639\nif you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control,\n\n26\n00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.600\nyou need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to\n\n27\n00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.040\ntranslate that feeling to a more grounded medium. But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't\n\n28\n00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.600\ndo that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we\n\n29\n00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.320\nsee him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate\n\n30\n00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.240\nmetaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create\n\n31\n00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.160\nthe same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism\n\n32\n00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.360\ncan actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is\n\n33\n00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.480\nThe Last Five Years. For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical\n\n34\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.600\nmusical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual\n\n35\n00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.400\nbreakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety\n\n36\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.880\nand insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide\n\n37\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.880\nto her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and…\n\n38\n00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.520\nsorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script,\n\n39\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.760\nI don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out.\n\n40\n00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.640\nThe first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective. Jamie's side of the story is told\n\n41\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.800\nin chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her,\n\n42\n00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.200\nwhile Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and\n\n43\n00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.520\nending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well,\n\n44\n00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.240\nthe fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number\n\n45\n00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.960\ntoward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on\n\n46\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.640\nstage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the\n\n47\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.200\nactors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other\n\n48\n00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.040\nactor comes in to do their song. This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters,\n\n49\n00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.440\nit contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the\n\n50\n00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.160\nmusical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have\n\n51\n00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.040\nlimited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have,\n\n52\n00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.560\nand I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics\n\n53\n00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.920\nthemselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference\n\n54\n00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.120\nin how the two experience things. And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the\n\n55\n00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.400\ntwo characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces\n\n56\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.360\nthe idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time,\n\n57\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.560\nrather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the\n\n58\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.720\nlast five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship,\n\n59\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.000\nyou understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage\n\n60\n00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.680\nnot working. I say theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show\n\n61\n00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.960\nwhich are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does\n\n62\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.560\nwork out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting\n\n63\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.880\nher and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support\n\n64\n00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.560\nher and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and\n\n65\n00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.280\nmakes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a\n\n66\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.720\nsuccessful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for\n\n67\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.160\ntrying to advance his career. It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws\n\n68\n00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.760\nand warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out.\n\n69\n00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.360\nBut then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film,\n\n70\n00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:09.615\nstarring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did\n\n71\n00:06:09.615 --> 00:06:13.695\nNobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's\n\n72\n00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:19.295\njust piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine.\n\n73\n00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:24.255\nThe camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and\n\n74\n00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:29.135\nperspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy\n\n75\n00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:35.375\nthat you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment.\n\n76\n00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:40.335\nBut yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because\n\n77\n00:06:40.335 --> 00:06:45.695\nof any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again,\n\n78\n00:06:45.695 --> 00:06:51.375\nwe go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with\n\n79\n00:06:51.375 --> 00:06:56.975\nonly two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf.\n\n80\n00:06:56.975 --> 00:07:01.935\nBut that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental,\n\n81\n00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:06.655\nand too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set\n\n82\n00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:11.295\ndesign gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number\n\n83\n00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:17.135\nin it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone.\n\n84\n00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:23.375\nSo because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup.\n\n85\n00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:28.975\nBoth of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras\n\n86\n00:07:28.975 --> 00:07:34.495\nin each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie.\n\n87\n00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:41.295\nThis should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot\n\n88\n00:07:41.295 --> 00:07:46.655\nmore awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of\n\n89\n00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:51.135\nthe songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically,\n\n90\n00:07:51.135 --> 00:07:56.495\nsolos meant to be performed more at air than at living people. And because they're now being\n\n91\n00:07:56.495 --> 00:08:02.095\nperformed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes\n\n92\n00:08:02.095 --> 00:08:07.135\nwhere a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch\n\n93\n00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:12.335\nand try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance\n\n94\n00:08:12.335 --> 00:08:16.815\nit out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly.\n\n95\n00:08:16.815 --> 00:08:21.775\nThe end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a\n\n96\n00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:27.455\nsignificant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play\n\n97\n00:08:27.455 --> 00:08:32.255\nout in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of\n\n98\n00:08:32.255 --> 00:08:36.655\nof the show's impact. It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the\n\n99\n00:08:36.655 --> 00:08:40.955\nway you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is\n\n100\n00:08:40.955 --> 00:08:46.435\na biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more\n\n101\n00:08:46.435 --> 00:08:51.555\nconventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective.\n\n102\n00:08:51.555 --> 00:08:55.315\nIt really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in\n\n103\n00:08:55.315 --> 00:08:59.215\nthe first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather\n\n104\n00:08:59.215 --> 00:09:03.415\njust because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working\n\n105\n00:09:03.415 --> 00:09:08.175\non screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show.\n\n106\n00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:12.555\nAnd honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted\n\n107\n00:09:12.555 --> 00:09:17.415\nto film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with\n\n108\n00:09:17.415 --> 00:09:21.615\nthis. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical,\n\n109\n00:09:21.615 --> 00:09:24.895\nand legit just the direction being overall pretty shit.\n\n110\n00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:30.175\nDear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years.\n\n111\n00:09:30.175 --> 00:09:33.835\nIt follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical.\n\n112\n00:09:33.835 --> 00:09:37.915\nOpening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song,\n\n113\n00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:42.075\nscene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc.\n\n114\n00:09:42.075 --> 00:09:46.415\nThere's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly\n\n115\n00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:49.955\ndifferent than your average Disney musical when you get down to it.\n\n116\n00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:55.215\nSo translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible.\n\n117\n00:09:55.215 --> 00:10:00.415\nBut oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could.\n\n118\n00:10:00.415 --> 00:10:06.195\nThere's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical\n\n119\n00:10:06.195 --> 00:10:11.435\nmovies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it.\n\n120\n00:10:11.435 --> 00:10:15.575\nTom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's\n\n121\n00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:16.575\ncertainly the most notable.\n\n122\n00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:21.955\nFilms in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who\n\n123\n00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.975\nwill say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which\n\n124\n00:10:25.975 --> 00:10:27.695\njust… no.\n\n125\n00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:31.575\nLike even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life.\n\n126\n00:10:31.575 --> 00:10:36.395\nThe basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing\n\n127\n00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:37.735\nabout it.\n\n128\n00:10:37.735 --> 00:10:41.575\nSaying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a\n\n129\n00:10:41.575 --> 00:10:45.835\nsubdued opera or a good video game music cover band.\n\n130\n00:10:45.835 --> 00:10:49.535\nIt's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with.\n\n131\n00:10:49.535 --> 00:10:54.555\nAnd yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries.\n\n132\n00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:57.115\nThis isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton.\n\n133\n00:10:57.115 --> 00:11:00.735\nThere's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality.\n\n134\n00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:04.995\nLike I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed\n\n135\n00:11:04.995 --> 00:11:09.295\nby song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern\n\n136\n00:11:09.295 --> 00:11:14.155\nday world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers.\n\n137\n00:11:14.155 --> 00:11:18.695\nBut like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers\n\n138\n00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:22.275\nvia staging and blocking not be… bad.\n\n139\n00:11:22.275 --> 00:11:26.175\nTheoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is\n\n140\n00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:30.055\ngoing to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one.\n\n141\n00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:35.555\nA musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing\n\n142\n00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:36.555\nrhythm.\n\n143\n00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:41.675\nSo okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this.\n\n144\n00:11:41.675 --> 00:11:45.595\nIn the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the\n\n145\n00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:50.175\ndeviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's\n\n146\n00:11:50.175 --> 00:11:55.415\nstoryline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely\n\n147\n00:11:55.415 --> 00:12:10.151\nhate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million\n\n148\n00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:16.151\nshow-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return.\n\n149\n00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:21.831\nSongs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema.\n\n150\n00:12:21.831 --> 00:12:26.791\nCarnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and\n\n151\n00:12:26.791 --> 00:12:31.291\nshow off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch\n\n152\n00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:36.291\nof citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments\n\n153\n00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:40.591\neasier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that.\n\n154\n00:12:40.591 --> 00:12:44.611\nBut that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler\n\n155\n00:12:44.611 --> 00:12:49.611\nsequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has\n\n156\n00:12:49.611 --> 00:12:53.391\nto comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie\n\n157\n00:12:53.391 --> 00:12:58.571\nis just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon\n\n158\n00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:03.531\nand sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts\n\n159\n00:13:03.531 --> 00:13:08.691\nthat keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers.\n\n160\n00:13:08.691 --> 00:13:12.611\nThere's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements\n\n161\n00:13:12.611 --> 00:13:16.631\nof the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting\n\n162\n00:13:16.631 --> 00:13:22.551\nbecause the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices.\n\n163\n00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:27.831\nBut okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen.\n\n164\n00:13:27.831 --> 00:13:32.491\nI wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird\n\n165\n00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:35.131\nmannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen.\n\n166\n00:13:35.131 --> 00:13:39.111\nWith that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In\n\n167\n00:13:39.111 --> 00:13:42.951\nthe Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song.\n\n168\n00:13:42.951 --> 00:13:47.851\nBreathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own\n\n169\n00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:52.351\nanxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming\n\n170\n00:13:52.351 --> 00:13:57.931\nback home. To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly\n\n171\n00:13:57.931 --> 00:14:03.531\naimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again,\n\n172\n00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:07.851\nwe have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The\n\n173\n00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:11.691\nother people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the\n\n174\n00:14:11.691 --> 00:14:16.131\ndances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing\n\n175\n00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:21.471\nyou might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against\n\n176\n00:14:21.471 --> 00:14:26.911\nNina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result is that despite this number being so\n\n177\n00:14:26.911 --> 00:14:32.111\ndownbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting\n\n178\n00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:37.631\nsomething that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music.\n\n179\n00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:41.391\nNow let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song,\n\n180\n00:14:41.391 --> 00:14:44.991\nwaving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin?\n\n181\n00:14:44.991 --> 00:14:49.631\nSo the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare\n\n182\n00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:54.911\nbecause this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do.\n\n183\n00:14:54.911 --> 00:15:01.311\nYou see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine. Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room.\n\n184\n00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:06.031\nIt's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here\n\n185\n00:15:06.031 --> 00:15:10.991\nthat are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap. I understand what\n\n186\n00:15:10.991 --> 00:15:15.631\nthey're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like.\n\n187\n00:15:15.631 --> 00:15:20.911\nBut they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's like you don't even want to be around\n\n188\n00:15:20.911 --> 00:15:25.151\nwatching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work,\n\n189\n00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:29.471\nit's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin,\n\n190\n00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:34.271\nwhich is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once again,\n\n191\n00:15:34.271 --> 00:15:38.591\nyou have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around\n\n192\n00:15:38.591 --> 00:15:43.391\nand sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything\n\n193\n00:15:43.391 --> 00:15:49.311\ncomplex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on.\n\n194\n00:15:49.311 --> 00:15:54.271\nAnd in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the\n\n195\n00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:58.591\nkitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the\n\n196\n00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:03.951\nrefrigerator light. But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the\n\n197\n00:16:03.951 --> 00:16:09.311\nLes Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death,\n\n198\n00:16:09.311 --> 00:16:13.951\nShe thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine.\n\n199\n00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:18.191\nLike the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window,\n\n200\n00:16:18.191 --> 00:16:22.671\nand then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun.\n\n201\n00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:27.311\nAnd it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an\n\n202\n00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:33.871\nactual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children\n\n203\n00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:38.671\nexcept this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it.\n\n204\n00:16:38.671 --> 00:16:45.231\nYou are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands.\n\n205\n00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:49.351\nOnce Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are\n\n206\n00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:50.351\ndirected.\n\n207\n00:16:50.351 --> 00:16:53.691\nOnce again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here.\n\n208\n00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:57.851\nYou see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring\n\n209\n00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.831\nhim and focusing solely on their own lives.\n\n210\n00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:04.711\nIt's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around\n\n211\n00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:05.711\nothers.\n\n212\n00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:10.091\nBut it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with\n\n213\n00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:13.211\nno real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything.\n\n214\n00:17:13.211 --> 00:17:17.091\nThey don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they\n\n215\n00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:21.151\njust gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera.\n\n216\n00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:25.771\nIt just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song.\n\n217\n00:17:25.771 --> 00:17:30.051\nAnd it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too\n\n218\n00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:35.351\non beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc\n\n219\n00:17:35.351 --> 00:17:39.751\nshot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at.\n\n220\n00:17:39.751 --> 00:17:46.311\nOnce again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this\n\n221\n00:17:46.311 --> 00:17:50.871\nis how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going\n\n222\n00:17:50.871 --> 00:17:57.351\nto look like when not in anxiety mode. It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy\n\n223\n00:17:57.351 --> 00:18:13.606\nnot actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in\n\n224\n00:18:13.606 --> 00:18:17.866\nthe same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it.\n\n225\n00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:21.766\nIt just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it\n\n226\n00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:25.206\nworse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as\n\n227\n00:18:25.206 --> 00:18:28.406\nEvan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else.\n\n228\n00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:34.006\nway that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers\n\n229\n00:18:34.006 --> 00:18:39.686\nin the film have. Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and\n\n230\n00:18:39.686 --> 00:18:44.566\nrealistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene,\n\n231\n00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:48.486\nthe weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it.\n\n232\n00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:53.206\nDear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to\n\n233\n00:18:53.206 --> 00:18:57.526\nlook just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers.\n\n234\n00:18:57.526 --> 00:19:02.806\nIt certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever,\n\n235\n00:19:02.806 --> 00:19:08.486\nanother Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with\n\n236\n00:19:08.486 --> 00:19:13.846\nConnor to Connor's family. Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt\n\n237\n00:19:13.846 --> 00:19:19.126\nbasically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile,\n\n238\n00:19:19.126 --> 00:19:24.006\nwith maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there.\n\n239\n00:19:24.006 --> 00:19:28.006\nAnd this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space,\n\n240\n00:19:28.006 --> 00:19:32.886\nwanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes.\n\n241\n00:19:32.886 --> 00:19:38.566\nThe stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy\n\n242\n00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:42.486\nHouse. The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in\n\n243\n00:19:42.486 --> 00:19:47.286\nsomeone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way\n\n244\n00:19:47.286 --> 00:19:52.566\ntoo grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels\n\n245\n00:19:52.566 --> 00:19:57.286\nlike a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable.\n\n246\n00:19:57.926 --> 00:20:04.886\nThen there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell\n\n247\n00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:09.686\nHer, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor\n\n248\n00:20:09.686 --> 00:20:15.046\nactually thought of her. It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is\n\n249\n00:20:15.046 --> 00:20:19.446\nsupposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented\n\n250\n00:20:19.446 --> 00:20:24.386\nto Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to\n\n251\n00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:28.406\nstage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it.\n\n252\n00:20:28.406 --> 00:20:33.766\nIn the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room,\n\n253\n00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:37.506\nwhich in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan\n\n254\n00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:41.566\ngets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing\n\n255\n00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:46.446\na kiss. It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate\n\n256\n00:20:46.446 --> 00:20:50.926\nas the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final\n\n257\n00:20:50.926 --> 00:20:54.926\nmoments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence.\n\n258\n00:20:55.566 --> 00:21:00.446\nBut then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action\n\n259\n00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:05.406\nbeing Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen.\n\n260\n00:21:05.406 --> 00:21:10.766\nAnd like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've\n\n261\n00:21:10.766 --> 00:21:15.326\nseen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he\n\n262\n00:21:15.326 --> 00:21:20.766\nwants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out. It makes a song that was mildly\n\n263\n00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:26.126\ncreepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these\n\n264\n00:21:26.126 --> 00:21:31.726\nflashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while\n\n265\n00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:36.766\nsinging about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes.\n\n266\n00:21:37.406 --> 00:21:42.126\nBoth the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have,\n\n267\n00:21:42.126 --> 00:21:46.606\nas they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback,\n\n268\n00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:50.686\nand then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other. The moments where the two sit\n\n269\n00:21:50.686 --> 00:21:56.206\nbeside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good.\n\n270\n00:21:56.206 --> 00:22:01.486\nThere's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed\n\n271\n00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:06.446\nup a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all. Super, super\n\n272\n00:22:06.446 --> 00:22:10.766\noverkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they\n\n273\n00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:15.586\nrealized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up\n\n274\n00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:20.886\nand kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just…\n\n275\n00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:21.886\nwild to me.\n\n276\n00:22:21.886 --> 00:22:26.646\nLike, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around. What\n\n277\n00:22:26.646 --> 00:22:32.286\nwould they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops\n\n278\n00:22:32.286 --> 00:22:37.406\nhis cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess\n\n279\n00:22:37.406 --> 00:22:42.606\nup his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe\n\n280\n00:22:42.606 --> 00:22:47.246\nwhat he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad\n\n281\n00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:52.526\nemotional scene, I shit you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices\n\n282\n00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:58.766\npossible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on\n\n283\n00:22:58.766 --> 00:23:04.526\nshot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes\n\n284\n00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:09.646\nthat are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no\n\n285\n00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:13.646\nother interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything.\n\n286\n00:23:13.646 --> 00:23:18.286\nThis can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the\n\n287\n00:23:18.286 --> 00:23:23.646\nway they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe\n\n288\n00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:28.286\nexpressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her\n\n289\n00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:33.326\ndead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore\n\n290\n00:23:33.326 --> 00:23:36.086\nor all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird.\n\n291\n00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:41.126\nAnd the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated\n\n292\n00:23:41.126 --> 00:23:44.986\nin their own frames, away from each other and across the room.\n\n293\n00:23:44.986 --> 00:23:48.226\nI'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often.\n\n294\n00:23:48.226 --> 00:23:51.946\nIf I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to\n\n295\n00:23:51.946 --> 00:23:56.866\nchoreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option.\n\n296\n00:23:56.866 --> 00:24:01.326\nBut another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions,\n\n297\n00:24:01.326 --> 00:24:05.006\nbecause yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every\n\n298\n00:24:05.006 --> 00:24:05.946\nshot you see on screen is a very good shot.\n\n",

There are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall not great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be the best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take shot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers. It really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others. There's also some bit of cinematography I like. I know I ragged on For Forever, but I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window, Connor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan. It shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail, when we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window, but this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame, showing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid. It's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job expressing how the characters feel through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best elevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the musical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall problem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard. Part of the problem with doing the thing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie, is that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel will get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best to ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want you to cry. That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the entire movie. The weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy. Like, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be. made sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension. I mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes all in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite the movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour. It's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all in on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the song that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health. And every single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the story and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this. I'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something, I'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something emotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing the comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless. but weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise. Dear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main character. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement of that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands the absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human. By showing him engaging in conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments that are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show and see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played so dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going on. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to think about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think about how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication. And without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going to drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical numbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material so much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it more, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before. Or at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse. Musical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work, like how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by changing the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in the real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go, Saying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged. It's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Hairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable experiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own, away from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension. And then you have the bad ones, the ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of the original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films, unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these are the only way that most people can experience them. Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want to experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording, you're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were other options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a musical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time that ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom movie sucks, well, Sorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance. However, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this. But this increased demand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online. This dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations. Before the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot harder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just google that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily. Not that I would condone such a thing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime tutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only way for people to consume shows during that time. And I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected the way theatre companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly and super easily. Someone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know the one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on YouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years. It definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of thing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more shows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's going on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects are still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation. But if the visuals, or questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage version of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source that's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting recent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new- they've technically been around for a while. But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film adaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could potentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were generally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be open for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Although, pretty much every show has has a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just that most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact. That being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why you still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't really a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video stuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts. And it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could change though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD professional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the recording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public. And sure enough, the mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full theatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead, it was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd, 2020. And it was a huge, huge success. Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this, the Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show. Whatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton, you'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Hamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly high number. It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances, audiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place to distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and watch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows they're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them. And the demand for such things is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will affect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance years before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success. We have seen one, though. Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a feature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of a live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped. However, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film adaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV. And while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near as popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material would have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole debate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather have Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better quality product. And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this is a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that, especially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing, plodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst. But as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge, it's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't. And it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films like In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie for real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and don't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening certainly for real this time, guys. I went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because it's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come from a place of hate, but out of love. I love musicals. I love them a lot. I think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful amalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like a clusterfucked homunculus. During the writing process, after this script had already been mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell, just from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything about it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many of Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love. So much of what he's written has resonated with so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible way of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively with other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up to be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the same space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced in another medium. When you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at the same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their very discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but by the fact that it's theatre. This was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has put into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium. It's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we even get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting on West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's still an audience out there for the musical movie. It's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the video, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting than their stage counterparts. But these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is and what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting piece of art. One of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals. Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's alive and a little bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little sad to see. And that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that. In all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over the past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again have to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my favorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of storytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily expect. In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case study for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a collaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like. People like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice, or even just recently, my co-writer Emily. For one, it lets us make videos that might not be best suited for YouTube. Like I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which automatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its way onto YouTube. So not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored segments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that you can only find on that platform. So for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning to become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches. But you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and technology. And it's incredibly cool. If you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means and how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals and how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really amazing. If you want to watch Debater Theatre, Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical, or anything else on CuriosityStream or Nebula, all you have to do is go to curiositystream.com slash sarahz and use my coupon code sarahz at checkout. You'll get access to both CuriosityStream and Nebula.

So that's something, and would explain why they really\n\n2\n00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.120\ntry to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames.\n\n3\n00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.760\nThere are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall\n\n4\n00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.000\nnot great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be\n\n5\n00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.960\nthe best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take\n\n6\n00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.280\nshot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers.\n\n7\n00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.440\nIt really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others.\n\n8\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.760\nThere's also some bit of cinematography I like. I know I ragged on For Forever,\n\n9\n00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.640\nbut I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window,\n\n10\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.440\nConnor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan.\n\n11\n00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.800\nIt shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and\n\n12\n00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.600\ndistant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail,\n\n13\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.600\nwhen we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window,\n\n14\n00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160\nbut this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame,\n\n15\n00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.880\nshowing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid.\n\n16\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.760\nIt's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job\n\n17\n00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.640\nexpressing how the characters feel through framing.\n\n18\n00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.640\nAs a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best\n\n19\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.720\nelevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the\n\n20\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.760\nmusical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall\n\n21\n00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.640\nproblem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard. Part of the problem with doing the\n\n22\n00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.680\nthing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical\n\n23\n00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.120\nacclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie,\n\n24\n00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.040\nis that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel\n\n25\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.760\nwill get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best\n\n26\n00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.240\nto ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw.\n\n27\n00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.800\nAnd not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just\n\n28\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.000\nsapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of\n\n29\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.160\neveryone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want\n\n30\n00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.760\nyou to cry. That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is.\n\n31\n00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:59.500\nI was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the\n\n32\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.620\nentire movie.\n\n33\n00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.500\nThe weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy.\n\n34\n00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.400\nLike, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say,\n\n35\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.740\nWorld's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be.\n\n36\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.620\nmade sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension.\n\n37\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.100\nI mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes\n\n38\n00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.800\nall in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite\n\n39\n00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.260\nthe movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour.\n\n40\n00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.980\nIt's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen\n\n41\n00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.900\nas this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all\n\n42\n00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.940\nin on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the\n\n43\n00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.840\nsong that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed\n\n44\n00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.380\nas a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health. And\n\n45\n00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.940\nevery single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the\n\n46\n00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.940\nstory and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this.\n\n47\n00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.180\nI'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something,\n\n48\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.380\nI'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something\n\n49\n00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.540\nemotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing\n\n50\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.580\nthe comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless.\n\n51\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.580\nbut weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements,\n\n52\n00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.260\nyou're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise.\n\n53\n00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.220\nDear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main\n\n54\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.180\ncharacter. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement\n\n55\n00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.700\nof that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands\n\n56\n00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.280\nthe absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing.\n\n57\n00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.620\nAnd more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human. By showing him engaging\n\n58\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.260\nin conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments\n\n59\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.560\nthat are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show\n\n60\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.660\nand see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played\n\n61\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.580\nso dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going\n\n62\n00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.860\non. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to\n\n63\n00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.200\nthink about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction\n\n64\n00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.840\nto Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think\n\n65\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.340\nabout how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's\n\n66\n00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.080\nsuicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication.\n\n67\n00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.240\nAnd without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going\n\n68\n00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:09.880\nto drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical\n\n69\n00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.479\nnumbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material\n\n70\n00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:21.240\nso much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it\n\n71\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.520\nmore, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before.\n\n72\n00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.880\nOr at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse.\n\n73\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.479\nMusical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work,\n\n74\n00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.479\nlike how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by\n\n75\n00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.360\nchanging the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in\n\n76\n00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.759\nthe real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go,\n\n77\n00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.400\nSaying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche\n\n78\n00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.760\nis as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged.\n\n79\n00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.080\nIt's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage\n\n80\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.360\ncounterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even\n\n81\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.720\nHairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable\n\n82\n00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:21.159\nexperiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own,\n\n83\n00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:25.960\naway from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension. And then you have the bad ones,\n\n84\n00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.520\nthe ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods,\n\n85\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:35.479\nwhich aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of\n\n86\n00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:41.080\nthe original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films,\n\n87\n00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.199\nunfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these\n\n88\n00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.240\nare the only way that most people can experience them. Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want\n\n89\n00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.479\nto experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording,\n\n90\n00:07:55.479 --> 00:08:01.720\nyou're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were\n\n91\n00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:11.800\nother options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a\n\n92\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.440\nmusical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time\n\n93\n00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.599\nthat ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off\n\n94\n00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:25.479\nthe project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom\n\n95\n00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:31.080\nof the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom movie sucks, well,\n\n96\n00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.600\nSorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance.\n\n97\n00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.799\nHowever, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this. But this increased\n\n98\n00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:43.799\ndemand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for\n\n99\n00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:48.920\nthe distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online.\n\n100\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.760\nThis dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations.\n\n101\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.160\nBefore the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot\n\n102\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.280\nharder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just\n\n103\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.400\ngoogle that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily. Not that I would condone such a\n\n104\n00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:12.520\nthing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to\n\n105\n00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.200\nimmortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime\n\n106\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.120\ntutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence\n\n107\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.200\nin 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only\n\n108\n00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.459\nway for people to consume shows during that time.\n\n109\n00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:36.360\nAnd I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected\n\n110\n00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.940\nthe way theatre companies viewed bootlegs.\n\n111\n00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:43.780\nBeforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly\n\n112\n00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.780\nand super easily.\n\n113\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:50.079\nSomeone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know\n\n114\n00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:55.760\nthe one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown\n\n115\n00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.600\nand Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on\n\n116\n00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.480\nYouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years.\n\n117\n00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.760\nIt definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of\n\n118\n00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.720\nthing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more\n\n119\n00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.720\nshows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera\n\n120\n00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.120\nwon't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's\n\n121\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.240\ngoing on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects\n\n122\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.319\nare still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching\n\n123\n00:10:38.319 --> 00:10:45.280\nthe camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation. But if the visuals,\n\n124\n00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.120\nor questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage\n\n125\n00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:55.839\nversion of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source\n\n126\n00:10:55.839 --> 00:11:01.040\nthat's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting\n\n127\n00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.480\nrecent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new-\n\n128\n00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.520\nthey've technically been around for a while. But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film\n\n129\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:15.920\nadaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could\n\n130\n00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:20.800\npotentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were\n\n131\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.360\ngenerally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be\n\n132\n00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:31.199\nopen for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent\n\n133\n00:11:31.199 --> 00:11:36.800\nand Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Although, pretty much every show has\n\n134\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.620\nhas a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just\n\n135\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:46.400\nthat most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact.\n\n136\n00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.560\nThat being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why\n\n137\n00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.400\nyou still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't\n\n138\n00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:13.639\nreally a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video\n\n139\n00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:18.440\nstuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts.\n\n140\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.760\nAnd it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could\n\n141\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.760\nchange though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD\n\n142\n00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.560\nprofessional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the\n\n143\n00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:37.800\nrecording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public. And sure enough,\n\n144\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.920\nthe mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full\n\n145\n00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.519\ntheatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead,\n\n146\n00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:54.199\nit was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd,\n\n147\n00:12:54.199 --> 00:13:00.519\n2020. And it was a huge, huge success. Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton,\n\n148\n00:13:00.519 --> 00:13:04.839\ndiscourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this,\n\n149\n00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:10.600\nthe Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show.\n\n150\n00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.000\nWhatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton,\n\n151\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.880\nyou'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality\n\n152\n00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:24.920\ninitial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive.\n\n153\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.920\nStreaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates,\n\n154\n00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:34.839\nHamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly\n\n155\n00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:39.560\nhigh number. It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right\n\n156\n00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:45.959\nbehind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances,\n\n157\n00:13:45.959 --> 00:13:51.260\naudiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full\n\n158\n00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.360\nfilm adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place\n\n159\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.800\nto distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and\n\n160\n00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.699\nwatch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows\n\n161\n00:14:05.699 --> 00:14:10.579\nthey're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them. And the demand for such\n\n162\n00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:15.940\nthings is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will\n\n163\n00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.060\naffect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance\n\n164\n00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:26.260\nyears before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success.\n\n165\n00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:31.699\nWe have seen one, though. Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a\n\n166\n00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:36.819\nfeature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its\n\n167\n00:14:36.819 --> 00:14:41.699\nappeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of\n\n168\n00:14:41.699 --> 00:14:46.420\na live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was\n\n169\n00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.980\nimpossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped.\n\n170\n00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:56.500\nHowever, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film\n\n171\n00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.779\nadaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV.\n\n172\n00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:06.339\nAnd while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near\n\n173\n00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:11.140\nas popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a\n\n174\n00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.860\nwatch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material\n\n175\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.260\nwould have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole\n\n176\n00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.060\ndebate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather\n\n177\n00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.339\nhave Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal\n\n178\n00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:35.300\nPictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better\n\n179\n00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.260\nquality product. And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this\n\n180\n00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:45.140\nis a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future.\n\n181\n00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.300\nDear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that,\n\n182\n00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:55.779\nespecially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing,\n\n183\n00:15:55.779 --> 00:16:00.819\nplodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst.\n\n184\n00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:05.220\nBut as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that\n\n185\n00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:11.540\nDear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease.\n\n186\n00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.100\nMusical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently.\n\n187\n00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:20.579\nAfter their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge,\n\n188\n00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:26.100\nit's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't.\n\n189\n00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.260\nAnd it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films\n\n190\n00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:36.100\nlike In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan\n\n191\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.819\nHansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie\n\n192\n00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:45.779\nfor real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and\n\n193\n00:16:45.779 --> 00:16:50.100\ndon't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening\n\n194\n00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.660\ncertainly for real this time, guys.\n\n195\n00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.980\nI went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because\n\n196\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:01.380\nit's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought\n\n197\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.900\nabout it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come\n\n198\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.599\nfrom a place of hate, but out of love.\n\n199\n00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:09.599\nI love musicals.\n\n200\n00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.900\nI love them a lot.\n\n201\n00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:15.099\nI think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain\n\n202\n00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.099\nand enlighten.\n\n203\n00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:21.300\nIt's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful\n\n204\n00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:27.140\namalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like\n\n205\n00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:32.020\na clusterfucked homunculus. During the writing process, after this script had already been\n\n206\n00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:36.980\nmostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell,\n\n207\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.860\njust from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute\n\n208\n00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.919\nfavorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything\n\n209\n00:17:46.919 --> 00:17:52.260\nabout it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many\n\n210\n00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.240\nof Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love. So much of what he's written has resonated\n\n211\n00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:12.240\nwith so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible\n\n212\n00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.920\nway of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively\n\n213\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.160\nwith other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up\n\n214\n00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:27.020\nto be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the\n\n215\n00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.780\nsame space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced\n\n216\n00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.200\nin another medium.\n\n217\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.380\nWhen you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at\n\n218\n00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.940\nthe same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their\n\n219\n00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:48.040\nvery discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but\n\n220\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.360\nby the fact that it's theatre.\n\n221\n00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.060\nThis was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has\n\n222\n00:18:55.060 --> 00:19:00.260\nput into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium.\n\n223\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.220\nIt's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures\n\n224\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:10.100\nof Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of\n\n225\n00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.380\nHamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we\n\n226\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:20.980\neven get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting\n\n227\n00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.140\non West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's\n\n228\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.620\nstill an audience out there for the musical movie.\n\n229\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.140\nIt's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the\n\n230\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.020\nvideo, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting\n\n231\n00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.020\nthan their stage counterparts.\n\n232\n00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.540\nBut these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is\n\n233\n00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:47.680\nand what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting\n\n234\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.940\npiece of art.\n\n235\n00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.880\nOne of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection\n\n236\n00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.360\nof what makes musicals musicals.\n\n237\n00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:00.260\nOf strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's\n\n238\n00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.700\nalive and a little bit exaggerated.\n\n239\n00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.360\nAnd as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little\n\n240\n00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.840\nsad to see.\n\n241\n00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.880\nAnd that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing\n\n242\n00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:17.060\nthe current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that.\n\n243\n00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.820\nIn all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over\n\n244\n00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:25.460\nthe past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again\n\n245\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:30.340\nhave to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my\n\n246\n00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.660\nfavorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of\n\n247\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:39.380\nstorytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily\n\n248\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.500\nexpect. In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case\n\n249\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.980\nstudy for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy\n\n250\n00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:54.500\nDebater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a\n\n251\n00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:58.980\ncollaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like.\n\n252\n00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.860\nPeople like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice,\n\n253\n00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.700\nor even just recently, my co-writer Emily. For one, it lets us make videos that might not be\n\n254\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.440\nbest suited for YouTube.\n\n255\n00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.420\nLike I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which\n\n256\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.580\nautomatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization.\n\n257\n00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.060\nWith Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its\n\n258\n00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.380\nway onto YouTube.\n\n259\n00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.300\nSo not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored\n\n260\n00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.120\nsegments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that\n\n261\n00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.420\nyou can only find on that platform.\n\n262\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:38.380\nSo for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning\n\n263\n00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.200\nto become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive\n\n264\n00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:49.620\nrhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches.\n\n265\n00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.260\nBut you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you\n\n266\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.180\nhopefully love.\n\n267\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.320\nNebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands\n\n268\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.360\nof absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and\n\n269\n00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.480\ntechnology. And it's incredibly cool.\n\n270\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.120\nIf you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called\n\n271\n00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.560\nCan a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means\n\n272\n00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.740\nand how it relates to human creativity.

Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video, um, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that you're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just giving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a breaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly producing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right? Um, on a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it? So you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking on this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good. Not only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was also just a pretty bad film in its own right. And all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels that have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie. Though out of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is titled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite. But Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been in the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably hearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film adaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting to come to fruition. Both casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that of Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with lots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters start their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even if they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role and just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen. Dear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously bad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to play a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually just looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps happening. We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these embarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations that are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly muted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have you. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just… fascinating. And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking about adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear Evan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the translation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals in general. So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal? So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015. When the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously thinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it. You know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up, and Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway. And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who did do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight. So, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be referenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer. I saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything. Evan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins, which is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc. He struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real friends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house, her family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity, and he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles, and prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor. Evan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter on him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their four best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong-armed and interrupted the first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along with the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along He gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him as a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes viral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died. We also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is extremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also either suicidal or just mentally ill in general, and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to hide that fact. In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's family is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up confessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts to repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year later, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and the two of them reflect on all of what happened. The musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number of changes made from the final edition. There was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts and apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut. You can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff like the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call. It was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna be in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same throughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows. One notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of Alana who went through a different actor at every reading. They were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who they wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines through most performances and adaptations of the show. When they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the project. It's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview period- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really wasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead of just dropping the show is extremely funny, though. According to Justin Paul, one of the three people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot take Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they finally had a finished show. And this thing was a huge fucking hit. Dear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety of different reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show, its representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships between all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen and his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people felt that it was able to create. Not only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had the musical up against a number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them, also including Best Musical. Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the show later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all of these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog Day I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of tickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept. But Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically impressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the very least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten. And while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award success and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social media platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise of shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy, or to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only get that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have been friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well, what if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together? So you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen, or just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success and popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had. This has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather got, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community as of late. Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head, I can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their primary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and they tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway. Nowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's, which ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following in two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for so much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning Thief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers and popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness. Shows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly to a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too. This divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever, but usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act politely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like, existing in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them. That critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are, while not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens. Shows like Mean Girls or Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex, relatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a limited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right now and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible tends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation for such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good. So as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans who only like teen musicals thing. That being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter, and the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not liking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical would get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action Beauty and the Beast. Another thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced and started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people would hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume it's a coming out story about a gay kid. I did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this. So when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia page for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family whose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter and also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what the fuck? So there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is a musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible and bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show handles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal with how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately by the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed. Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had a lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like The Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was actually about. And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures of Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school student, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse. So you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question of like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source material poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like, its source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material, and the other is a failure to adapt it correctly. So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good? Both in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about mental health. Eh. It was fine. Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor you see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts grief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done, there are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story. Especially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom. It manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms trying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him, we are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection with his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan with a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son while having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like, social media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come with a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less as their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity. There's a lot to like about this show, and I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window, connected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times, and every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me reconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that. But it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show. There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of the songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important character of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature, but songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good. The show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in their full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it first came out was its depiction of social media. Because like, yeah, we do see that a little. Evan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube. My speech? People started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere. Your speech is everywhere. This morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it. How many does it have now? 4,580. 16,239! He is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and the less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the less likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how we're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment of yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of abusive comments and phone calls online. So it's definitely a present theme in the show, but it's very much only explored on a surface level. We don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean on it sometimes and going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising money, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows him to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared to in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way. There are weird little mental health nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off his meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words, he doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it. And I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad things, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more kind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it.",
                    " But it does at times struggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense. One of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful, and having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love, and Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't really talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good than bad, which is an interesting message. I don't… really agree with this point about punishment. Mostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see evildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want? He loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part of that family anymore. Do you want him to go to child jail too  What? But at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much beaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately. But at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications for others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because of something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible good that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again, there's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can do to a person, and they just don't. And finally, there's the fact that, for all the show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and whatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really more a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story centering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his life are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques is the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by others, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to. But I think the message is weakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor, or to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end up being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly uncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself. And then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work. Alana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing the lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be a suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan. A depressed girl who, instead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending on how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which is largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike Evan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations besides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between either a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles. It's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that Alana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really work. And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show, be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is really… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love it, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either hate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely mid-tier show. One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths, but at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future version of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of those aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut out the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked. And actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out stuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work. So like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is bad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from an adaptational standpoint. Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in general. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's to be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible from the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film is always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie musicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original. But then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen. And there's just so much here that's just really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie. Very much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting, and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild. I will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and that is the fact that James Corden is not in it. Other than that, there's a lot to look at here. So Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film back in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation. He originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician like a year prior. His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be Ben Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at this point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look old. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late twenties. Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly look like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from watching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much younger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter. Also, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer eraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak. But the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually fucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage, and makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how exactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up getting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something. Evan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally not as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on stage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done and as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid. He's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt on camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are watching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable to us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance section feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought him this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that we're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music. And the thing is, this is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's Broadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors in their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your casting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is. is. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening on stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story. So this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social media posts will pop up throughout the show. This is obviously like a metaphorical representation of social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience, convey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its faults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage. The way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt, isn't literal. There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things will act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a representation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much. Half the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more complicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space of Matilda. Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't just fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and costumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like a literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role, it's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping into the space. The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best best most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a movie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more literal representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look really fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close, and in a much more grounded and realistic setting. So when you're making a movie, whether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a lot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever you're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active effort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls apart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit, if your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious. Meryl Streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods, which is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the the more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed back into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action film just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the film with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like very… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags under her eyes. She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a fetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and she would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout every scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well, the differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context of its realism. In terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine. There were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super in depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor playing that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women. But other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their job. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the unfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still hinges on Evan. Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone else. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this show comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled into the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the story because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen looks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way that we could on stage. But even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still can't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go beyond just who is acting in it. Another really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music, And the film unfortunately fucks this up too. So something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted to film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen. You are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going to be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical. So for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're the wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations like Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful Ghosts from the Cats movie. And generally speaking, this is just something you're going to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always bad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies' Choice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more of a chance to sing. But these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical. Part of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the films is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song. Which you know is fine. If they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure. But it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were these deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like, come on. We all know that that is absolutely never the real reason. It sucks. But it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward places in the story, and two, the songs being very generic. That was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of the context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the time when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original music, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later. But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with Alana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the original show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the only one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we don't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out in the film's favour. Unfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental health, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea that lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering in this way. In terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where we didn't see much of it in the show. So in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg plays Alana. I'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was how they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because it's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film. I'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including ones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the most dour, depressing way possible. Everyone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental health, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very depressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film. He thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. He did? He thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. But Alana as a character especially suffers from this. In the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira. So what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs and achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness. Hey, how was your summer? Mine was productive. I did three internships and 90 hours of community service. The idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone like Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable. But the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks to Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really. You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications.",
                    " Well, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June. We were in school in June. So for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes, hey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad a lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who delivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life and her own struggles because that was missing in the original show. And we do have one of those rare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap in the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story and or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that were removed in the film. This is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top of being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend to be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less without the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth. So when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes, certain songs are just going to have to get cut. Or sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they do in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably never should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could have pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning isn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty. But these things don't just affect the cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs  that having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally speaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when a song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it being you sing when you can no longer speak. These tend to be points of heightened emotion that are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader story. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because it sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about with one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about their complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these characters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue. The song is really important, and it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate that movie. I hate that movie so much. Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source material. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show and just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with the baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people, one of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in anything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive is a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later see in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other people and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a Disney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it and then she just leaves. And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death of his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the responsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father, who did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle and making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film, by cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised, and the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children. So at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like, be careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like, what the fuck are they talking about? What does this have to do with anything we just watched in this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden? This is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the story are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods. In many ways, this theme is the show. My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a necessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from the narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers from a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why, and what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that. So, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad, bonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway. But they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing, Does Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the same time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids. It serves a few purposes. For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character whose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom. It lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like, which is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show. It establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and the Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes, their struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing the same words at the same time for a reason. And cutting it, instead opening right with Evan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The I Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because generally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a reason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are. You can't I have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who or what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints. Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general, cuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem. Because on top of cutting Does Anybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs in the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone who is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets from it are making him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is going great. He keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents, and as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting his friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother. The Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his own mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled. And Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the lies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the number where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him. They're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable. How he's only being with these people to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates the emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be discarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the burden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself. The song is important for several reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are explicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are affecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten. They are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working. There's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole, and the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again, deepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional comfort to Evan. It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions. And even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him, where he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real. And to reduce Heidi to a very limited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with like a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment. There's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a second because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole, the way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story, really acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like we saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a musical is fundamentally supposed to do. I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical episodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here. In terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time, that adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story. And that's, again, just a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different time constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new dialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie, or actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy, scripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original, or just things that wouldn't translate well to film. And that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of criticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to reframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage. And to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it. Beyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one, there are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but really add up. Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend, is made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made, beyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character. There is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact that there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do think the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled down to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ representation. I rub my nipples and start glowing with delight. How did you write that? There's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another. Has been rough. But not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay. But not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure Giving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice. This also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is the selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over and over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like Evan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions. Additionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor, and instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially address both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all. So in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret. Nobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens, and Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened. The film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page. I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied. Repeatedly. And then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor, who gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic. Evan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the Apple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change, but in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing. Part of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone bothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually see any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into how this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term. they simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening. It feels like a change there not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because they want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to adjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's favourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call. Even if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid. But it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh… Sorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic song. It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this standard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon. And the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor than the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film. As previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's home life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality. It's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like while he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around for the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except to say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him on what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab. Because like what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first 15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's. She just fucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the musical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience. You do that. You do that on stage. Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic. But in all seriousness, what this means is that even though we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This is the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos. The movie drops this entirely. I get why. Having scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to show on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this means is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely Me, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't really see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant portion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic acoustic radio hit. And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create more of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's emotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like the film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good apology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words. The way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material, which already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean and impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution and good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing? Perhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones that you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form. Things like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face. They're things you can easily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater theory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is performed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking and cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying to be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly what you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in your room. It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two different mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage won't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism. In a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is a real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance. You are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical space that you do. That means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess is the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then.",
                    " You can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into another scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would give the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage for the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment. But I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character interacts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small matter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who don't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set. Considering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience, rooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life. So a room in a stage show has a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience. And in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception that this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the crowd. I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the way a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because of the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to, could just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business, or sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film. Not really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth wall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured. And because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is, we generally expect them to record something matching close to reality. I don't mean that that we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real life. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists in the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of a believable world to us. It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in film as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and props tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre. Unless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, what the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly the root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical movies. If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage, it's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards and understandings of how everything should be presented  is… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's especially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage of time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create. It was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents, and then it snowballed out of control from there. And one of the things this show does do well is to convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing. Evan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world moves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the temporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family. In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact same feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him. But in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just move around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more grounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't really what we're seeing here. There are long stretches of time between the things Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really, he could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes, and along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to relate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer. The heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it can't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it, if you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control, you need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to translate that feeling to a more grounded medium. But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't do that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we see him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create the same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism can actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is The Last Five Years. For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical musical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual breakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety and insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide to her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and… sorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script, I don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out. The first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective. Jamie's side of the story is told in chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her, while Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and ending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well, the fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number toward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on stage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the actors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other actor comes in to do their song. This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have limited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have, and I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference in how the two experience things. And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the two characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces the idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time, rather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the last five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship, you understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage not working. I say theoretically. Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show which are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support her and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a successful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for trying to advance his career. It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out. But then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did Nobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine. The camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and perspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy that you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment. But yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because of any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again, we go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with only two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf. But that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental, and too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set design gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number in it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone. So because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup. Both of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras in each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie. This should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot more awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of the songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically, solos meant to be performed more at air than at living people. And because they're now being performed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch and try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance it out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly. The end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play out in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of of the show's impact. It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the way you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective. It really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in the first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather just because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working on screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show. And honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted to film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with this. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical, and legit just the direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years. It follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song, scene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc. There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly different than your average Disney musical when you get down to it. So translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible. But oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could. There's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's certainly the most notable. Films in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who will say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which just… no. Like even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing about it. Saying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a subdued opera or a good video game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with. And yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed by song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern day world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers. But like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers via staging and blocking not be… bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is going to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one. A musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm. So okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this. In the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the deviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely hate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million show-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return. Songs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema. Carnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and show off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments easier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that. But that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler sequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has to comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie is just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon and sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts that keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting because the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices. But okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In the Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song. Breathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own anxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming back home. To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again, we have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The other people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the dances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing you might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness. The end result is that despite this number being so downbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting something that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music. Now let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song, waving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin? So the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare because this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do. You see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine. Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room. It's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap. I understand what they're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like. But they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe. It's like you don't even want to be around watching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work, it's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin, which is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens. Once again, you have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around and sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything complex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on. And in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the refrigerator light. But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the Les Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death, She thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine. Like the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window, and then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun. And it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an actual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children except this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it. You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands. Once Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are directed. Once again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here. You see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him and focusing solely on their own lives. It's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around others. But it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with no real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they just gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song. And it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too on beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at. Once again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this is how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going to look like when not in anxiety mode. It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy not actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in the same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it. It just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as Evan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else. way that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers in the film have. Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and realistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene, the weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it.",
                    " Dear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to look just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers. It certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever, another Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with Connor to Connor's family. Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt basically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there. And this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space, wanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes. The stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy House. The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way too grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels like a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor actually thought of her. It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is supposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented to Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to stage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it. In the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room, which in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan gets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing a kiss. It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate as the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final moments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action being Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen. And like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've seen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he wants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out. It makes a song that was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these flashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while singing about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have, as they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other. The moments where the two sit beside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good. There's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed up a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all. Super, super overkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they realized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up and kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just… wild to me. Like, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around. What would they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops his cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess up his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe what he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad emotional scene, I shit you not. Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices possible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on shot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes that are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no other interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything. This can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the way they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore or all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird. And the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated in their own frames, away from each other and across the room. I'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often. If I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option. But another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions, because yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every shot you see on screen is a very good shot  is putting someone's life at risk. So that's something, and would explain why they really try to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames. There are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall not great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be the best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take shot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers. It really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others. There's also some bit of cinematography I like. I know I ragged on For Forever, but I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window, Connor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan. It shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail, when we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window, but this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame, showing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid. It's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job expressing how the characters feel through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best elevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the musical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall problem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard. Part of the problem with doing the thing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie, is that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel will get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best to ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want you to cry. That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the entire movie. The weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy. Like, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be. made sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension. I mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes all in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite the movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour. It's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all in on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the song that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health. And every single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the story and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this. I'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something, I'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something emotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing the comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless. but weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise. Dear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main character. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement of that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands the absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human. By showing him engaging in conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments that are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show and see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played so dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going on. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to think about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think about how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication. And without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going to drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical numbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material so much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it more, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before. Or at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse. Musical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work, like how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by changing the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in the real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go, Saying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged. It's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Hairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable experiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own, away from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension. And then you have the bad ones, the ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of the original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films, unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these are the only way that most people can experience them. Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want to experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording, you're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were other options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a musical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time that ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway. And if the Phantom movie sucks, well, Sorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance. However, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this. But this increased demand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online. This dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations. Before the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot harder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just google that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily. Not that I would condone such a thing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime tutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only way for people to consume shows during that time. And I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected the way theatre companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly and super easily. Someone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know the one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on YouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years. It definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of thing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more shows. Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's going on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects are still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation. But if the visuals, or questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage version of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source that's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting recent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new- they've technically been around for a while. But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film adaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could potentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were generally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be open for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings. Although, pretty much every show has has a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just that most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact. That being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why you still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't really a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video stuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts. And it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could change though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD professional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the recording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public. And sure enough, the mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full theatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead, it was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd, 2020. And it was a huge, huge success. Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this, the Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show. Whatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton, you'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Hamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly high number. It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances, audiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place to distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and watch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows they're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them. And the demand for such things is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will affect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance years before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success. We have seen one, though. Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a feature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of a live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped. However, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film adaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV. And while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near as popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material would have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole debate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather have Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better quality product. And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this is a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that, especially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing, plodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst. But as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge, it's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't. And it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films like In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie for real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and don't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening certainly for real this time, guys. I went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because it's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come from a place of hate, but out of love.",
                    " I love musicals. I love them a lot. I think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful amalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like a clusterfucked homunculus. During the writing process, after this script had already been mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell, just from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything about it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many of Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love. So much of what he's written has resonated with so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible way of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively with other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up to be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the same space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced in another medium. When you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at the same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their very discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but by the fact that it's theatre. This was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has put into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium. It's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we even get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting on West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's still an audience out there for the musical movie. It's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the video, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting than their stage counterparts. But these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is and what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting piece of art. One of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals. Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's alive and a little bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little sad to see. And that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that. In all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over the past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again have to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my favorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of storytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily expect. In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case study for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a collaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like. People like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice, or even just recently, my co-writer Emily. For one, it lets us make videos that might not be best suited for YouTube. Like I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which automatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its way onto YouTube. So not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored segments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that you can only find on that platform. So for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning to become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches. But you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and technology. And it's incredibly cool. If you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means and how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals and how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really amazing. If you want to watch Debater Theatre, Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical, or anything else on CuriosityStream or Nebula, all you have to do is go to curiositystream.com slash sarahz and use my coupon code sarahz at checkout. You'll get access to both CuriosityStream and Nebula.

They analyze what went wrong with the movie and how it failed to translate the stage show to the screen. The speaker also touches on the trend of musical adaptations and the challenges of bringing Broadway shows to the big screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has several issues, including poor casting choices, particularly with Ben Platt playing Evan Hansen at an age that doesn't align with the character's high school age. The film also struggles with translating the stage production to screen, making it hard to empathize with Evan's character. The music in the film is also criticized, with added songs feeling shoehorned and generic. The adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen for film has several issues, primarily with the cutting of certain songs and changes to the script. The speaker argues that these changes, such as cutting the song 'Does Anybody Have a Map?' and replacing 'Good For You' with a two-minute argument scene, detract from the story and characters. The film's attempts to address criticisms of the stage show, like making Evan admit to lying on social media, fall flat. The speaker also criticizes the film's direction and cinematography, saying they don't effectively translate the stage show to screen. The speaker discusses the difficulties of adapting stage musicals to film, using Dear Evan Hansen and The Last Five Years as examples. They highlight the differences between the two mediums, particularly in terms of how time and space are conveyed, and how musical numbers are staged and shot. The speaker argues that the film adaptations of these musicals often struggle to translate the unique qualities of the stage productions to the screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has been criticized for its awkward and uncomfortable musical numbers, poor directing, and drastic tonal shift from the stage show. The movie's attempts to ground the story in realism come across as forced and unnatural, leading to a dull and depressing viewing experience. The speaker argues that the film's problems are not unique to Dear Evan Hansen, but rather a symptom of a larger issue with musical film adaptations.

                        "The musical Dear Evan Hansen was a huge success on Broadway, winning six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. However, the speaker notes that the show has its weaknesses, including a lack of depth in its exploration of themes and forgettable music.",

                        "The film's scripting changes, such as making Jared gay and altering the ending, don't effectively address criticisms of the stage show and instead make the story feel hollow and impersonal.

                        "The fourth wall in stage productions allows for a unique interaction between the audience and the actors, which is difficult to replicate in film. This difference in medium can lead to challenges in adapting stage musicals to film.",

Get access to CuriosityStream and my streaming service Nebula and watch my Nebula exclusive video, Debater Theater at curiositystream.com slash sarahz. Hey guys, uh, so if you're wondering why it's been a little while since the last video, um, you know how life just kind of happens at you sometimes and then you kind of like realize that you're just burnt out and exhausted and just life stuff just keeps piling on and on and on and just giving you more and more difficult things to manage in your life, and you just kind of hit a breaking point and you just can't anymore and you're just fucking burnt out about constantly producing content. Um, so on an unrelated topic, um, mental health, am I right?",
                        "Um, on a completely additionally unrelated topic, Dear Evan Hansen, wasn't a very good movie, was it? So you might have missed this, since, you know, nobody else in the world was remarking on this or making videos on this, but a couple months ago, the film adaptation of famous musical Dear Evan Hansen came out, and it was, in fact, not very good. Not only was it just a bad translation of the Dear Evan Hansen material, but it was also just a pretty bad film in its own right. And all jokes aside, the movie has been talked about by a pretty good number of great channels that have broken down a lot of things that are just very bad about this movie.",
                        "Though out of all of them, the sequence where the speech goes viral and the YouTube video is titled, His Best Friend Just Died, You Won't Believe What Happens Next is still my favourite. But Dear Evan Hansen, for all its terribleness, isn't the only musical movie that's been in the news recently. On a much more recent note, anyone interested in musicals is probably hearing a lot right now after the new casting announcement for The Wicked Movie, a film adaptation that's been in development hell for ages and is, it seems, finally starting to come to fruition. Both casting decisions- both the casting of pop star Ariana Grande to play Glinda and that of Cynthia Erivo to play Elphaba have created a pretty big stir across social media, with lots of debates about things like how old the actors should be given that the characters start their story in university and whether it's okay to cast primarily pop singers even if they have a bit of theatre experience in a very vocally demanding musical theatre role and just generally what kind of choices you need to make while adapting a Broadway show to the screen.",
                        "Dear Evan Hansen, for all its awful nature, isn't alone in its status as a very, very notoriously bad adaptation of a Broadway musical. Before you had the horrors of a greying Ben Platt trying to play a high school student and looking way too old and hunching over to look younger but actually just looking like a dog that swallowed a bee, you had the horrific CGI nightmares that were Tom Hooper's Jellicle Cats. And I just… wanna talk about that. Because this somehow keeps happening.",
                        "We just keep having these like weird trainwreck musical adaptations that are just these embarrassingly bad imitations of the stage shows. Or possibly worse, we keep getting these adaptations that are, y'know, perfectly fine visually and have impressive casts, but are just incredibly muted and forgettable. You have your Into the Woodses and your live action Disneys and what have you. And the fact that these huge studios just consistently keep fucking this up is just… fascinating.",
                        "And well, y'all know me. I love musicals, I love bad movies, and I love talking about adaptations. So what I really want to do for this video is essentially break down the Dear Evan Hansen movie. What exactly didn't work about it, and how each aspect of it got lost in the translation between stage and screen, and what that can tell us about film adaptations of musicals in general.",
                        "So first of all, for those of you who haven't seen Dear Evan Hansen… what's this show's deal? So Dear Evan Hansen is a musical that swept the Broadway world when it formally released in 2015. When the show started to get popular on social media, you'd have a lot of people erroneously thinking it was about a gay kid and then reading the actual plot summary and just fucking losing it. You know, Dear Evan Hansen kinda sounds like Love, Simon enough that people often mix the two up, and Ben Platt is gay, and it's Broadway.",
                        "And there was a pretty big subsection of fandom who did do a lot of gay shipping, and like, I get it. But no, this one's straight. So, and warning for the rest of this video, mental health and suicide are going to be referenced throughout, just because that is what the story fundamentally is about, the show focuses on a character named Evan Hansen, or if you're RuPaul, a character named Deer. I saw Deer Evan Hansen on Broadway, and Ben Platt, who plays Deer, he gave everything.",
                        "Evan comes from a lower middle class family and suffers from severe anxiety, and we later learn that he had tried to take his own life a couple months before the show begins, which is the reason we see Evan's arm in a cast during the first arc. He struggles a lot with learning to interact with his peers, and doesn't really have any real friends or hobbies outside being scared to talk to the girl he likes, Zoe. Back at Zoe's house, her family is also dealing with a lot of dysfunction, her own brother Connor being very mentally unstable and violent. Evan has to write letters to himself as a therapy activity, and he writes this very sad one to himself that references Zoe and his own mental health struggles, and prints it out at school where it is stolen by Connor.",
                        "Evan later finds out that Connor has killed himself, and Connor's parents find this letter on him and erroneously believe that their son wrote the note, and Evan and Connor are their four best friends. He keeps trying to tell them the truth, but gets strong- armed and interrupted the first time and is too anxious to speak up the second time, until he ends up going along with the lie His family friend Jared ends up helping him fabricate email exchanges between Connor and Evan pretending they were friends and Evan starts deceiving Connor family including Zoe For a while Evan has a really idyllic life by playing along He gets to feel at home among this wealthy family who are now essentially treating him as a surrogate son, he ends up dating Zoe, and he becomes popular at school and goes viral due to his perceived connection with the kid who died. We also see a few interactions with the character of Alana, a girl at Evan's school who is extremely involved with extracurriculars and helps Evan set up a charity foundation in Connor's name. Her own life and struggles aren't super explored, but it's pretty heavily implied that Alana is also either suicidal or just mentally ill in general,",
                        "and is using her involvement in a lot of extracurriculars to hide that fact.",
                        "In any case, Evan is able to maintain the deception for a while, but ultimately he cracks under a mixture of the pressure to keep a bunch of lies going, the online abuse Connor's family is starting to receive, and his straining relationship with his own mother, and ends up confessing his deception to Connor's parents and Zoe, who then no longer want anything to do with Evan. Eventually, he loses the benefits that he had gained from the deception, but he also starts to repair his relationship with his mother. At the end, we see a short scene of him about a year later, having taken a year off before community college to work, as he talks to Zoey, and the two of them reflect on all of what happened. The musical had been workshopped for about a year, although there weren't a huge number of changes made from the final edition.",
                        "There was originally a song in it called Goin' Viral that quoted social media posts and apparently was reminiscent of Justin Bieber's Sorry, which later got cut. You can find some performances of it now, and it references some really dated stuff like the Uggs trend and Charlie bit my finger, so probably a good call. It was called The People Project at first, and Heather's Barrett Wilbert Weed was gonna be in it, but by and large the show and the rest of the cast mostly remained the same throughout the readings, something that isn't super common with a lot of Broadway shows. One notable exception, which we'll get touched on more a little later, is the character of Alana who went through a different actor at every reading.",
                        "They were apparently having trouble kind of finding the voice for the character and who they wanted her to be, a problem that honestly kind of never really got resolved, and shines through most performances and adaptations of the show. When they started actually staging it, it didn't work for a lot of audiences, poorly enough that apparently the show's creators were close to completely shutting down the project. It's not uncommon for shows to go through changes and rewrites during their preview period- that's essentially what the whole period is for- but the fact that it really wasn't working to that extent is interesting. The justification for making rewrites instead of just dropping the show is extremely funny, though.",
                        "According to Justin Paul, one of the three people who wrote the show, we were like, we can't do that to Ben Platt. Like, Ben Platt is like a sad little Victorian orphan they adopted and they're like, we cannot take Sickly Benjamin's traveling stage show from the township, not when he is consumptive. So they kept rewriting and reworking and, in the case of Alana, recasting until they finally had a finished show. And this thing was a huge fucking hit.",
                        "Dear Evan Hansen officially opened to a wave of positive reviews, praising it for a variety of different reasons. The inventiveness of incorporating social media and social media virality onto the show, its representation of anxiety and broader mental health concerns in general, the relationships between all of the characters, um, in particular that relationship between Dear Evan Hansen and his mom, and to a lesser extent, the contemporary music and the emotional resonance many people felt that it was able to create. Not only did it bring in a significant amount of praise in a variety of newspapers and in terms of attention and ticket sales, it also performed very well at the Tonys, which had the musical up against a number of other quite good shows. Dear Evan Hansen was nominated for 9 Tony's, including Best Musical, and won 6 of them, also including Best Musical.",
                        "Which, I'll talk more about my actual feelings on the show later, but I think is pretty interesting because for all its praise, pretty much all of these shows, at least in my opinion, are better than Dear Evan Hansen. Like, Groundhog Day I get not winning, it got a good 8 nominations that year but didn't really sell a lot of tickets or catch a lot of attention, and it's good, but it's also not like an original concept. But Come From Away, and especially Great Comet, are just these incredibly visually and technically impressive and also just good shows, and so to see a show about a high schooler with some fairly simple characters and a pretty basic pop soundtrack beat out the others was… a bit strange. At the very least, it was a testament to how popular Dear Evan Hansen had gotten.",
                        "And while that popularity also comes in the form of glowing reviews from journalists and award success and general praise for its whole concept, it also gained a pretty big fandom across social media platforms that were largely popular with teens. This was especially apparent in the rise of shipping media- be it fics, or fanart, or animatics, usually pairing Evan with Connor Murphy, or to a lesser but still present extent, his friend Jared. Of course, Connor and Evan only get that one very brief interaction in canon, and most of the musical is just Evan pretending to have been friends with Connor, but for a lot of people, that immediately begs the question of, well, what if Evan actually had been friends with Connor? What if they ended up getting together?",
                        "So you'd see a huge ton of media in that teen fandom niche either about Dear Evan Hansen, or just really about Evan and Connor. Dear Evan Hansen enjoyed quite a lot of success and popularity for quite a while after its inception. But one of the things that did earn it backlash was this teen fandom that it had. This has actually been a bit of an interesting shift in Broadway culture over the last five or six years Whether it the increasing accessibility of bootlegs that let people watch expensive musicals for free the growth of video sharing platforms like TikTok populated mostly by kids and teens or the late cult fandom that shows like Heather got, there's been a huge boost recently in Broadway shows either specifically about teens or marketed toward them, and this has become a pretty divisive thing in the Broadway community as of late.",
                        "Shows about, or 14s, aren't new or anything like that. Off the top of my head, I can think of shows like 13, or Carrie, or Bear, or even Bring It On that had school as their primary setting and aren't really new, but those shows were never as huge as they are today and they tended to be far and few between compared to the more adult-centric focus of Broadway. Nowadays though, especially following the online success of a show like Heather's, which ran off-Broadway and didn't make huge waves when it came out, but gained a massive following in two London revivals after an illegal recording of it got popular online, this trend has really exploded. Whether it's Dear Evan Hansen or Be More Chill or Mean Girls which I hate the music for so much and I am physically resisting the temptation to go off on a whole rant about, or The Lightning Thief or The Prom, these… YA shows, I guess is the right word, have blown up in their numbers and popularity recently, and with them has come divisiveness.",
                        "Shows that aren't fully about teens but are still largely popular with and marketed at least partly to a teen audience like Beetlejuice or Six are usually painted with this brush too. This divisiveness is broadly present when young people get into pretty much any new hobby ever, but usually the critiques are a mix of being frustrated with new fans not knowing how to act politely at Broadway shows, or only being interested in teen musicals, or just like, existing in such large numbers that people feel that the genre is now pandering to them. That critique is especially paired with the fact that many of these shows are, while not necessarily bad, also very simple. Like, they're for teens.",
                        "Shows like Mean Girls or Be More Chill tend to broadly feature fairly samey music that's easy to sing and not super complex, relatively simplistic and straightforward lyrics, and, well, teen themes. Some of the frustration, then, with the recent popularity of teen musicals is this idea that there can only really be a limited number of musicals that run on Broadway at any given time. And so many of the ones on right now and that seem to be getting made are just kind of okay and aren't super artistically interesting. At the same time, though, I dunno, more people getting into stuff and making it broadly accessible tends to generally be a net good, and when Broadway especially has had such a reputation for such a long time of being both geographically and financially inaccessible to most people, honestly, I think that anything that brings it to broader numbers is generally good.",
                        "So as much as I hate Mean Girls, count me out of the whole backlash against teen Broadway fans who only like teen musicals thing. That being said, the teen fandom Dear Evan Hansen gained, its high school subject matter, and the fact that it was being praised and winning awards over more technically impressive musicals like Great Comet earned it a fairly fast reputation for being overrated. Despite the kind of grumblings from people who don't love Dear Evan Hansen about not liking it or not getting what everyone sees in it, its success, both of the commercial and fandom variety, continued to skyrocket. And in 2020, it was announced that the musical would get a film adaptation directed by Steven Chbosky, the guy who wrote Perks of Being a Wallflower and directed Wonder and worked on other musical movies like Rent or live-action Beauty and the Beast.",
                        "Another thing on Backlash to Dear Evan Hansen is that when the film adaptation got announced and started getting press, there started to be this weird viral response to it where people would hear about it in the news and then learn what the story is actually about. Because, y'know, a lot of people who don't know anything about the show once again assume it's a coming out story about a gay kid. I did an informal poll of this on Twitter a while back, and a lot of people think this. So when your assumption is that it's another Love, Simon, and then you click on the Wikipedia page for it and it's like, Evan Hansen, a heterosexual male, lies to a grieving family whose son just died and scams his way into being close with them and dating their daughter and also everyone fucking loves this show and it won a bunch of Tonys, you might be like, what the fuck?",
                        "So there were a lot of hot takes on Dear Evan Hansen and how fucked up it is that this is a musical and like how nobody is talking about how fucked up this is and like this is so terrible and bad and etc etc etc. And it's not that there are no critiques to be made about how the show handles its themes. There's been a line of critique for quite a while that tries to deal with how the show portrays anxiety and whether Evan's actions are really treated appropriately by the story, but this was just like a lot of people who like read a Wikipedia summary and then went, oh my god, a morally ambiguous protagonist? That's not allowed.",
                        "Fucked up. So rumors were swirling about what the deal with this show is, and some of the cast was announced, including Ben Platt reprising his role as Deer. The show was kind of in this weird spot. You had a lot of hype for it from fans, especially just Ben Platt fans as he was still doing stuff like The Politician, but also this sudden shock and backlash as people learned what the show was actually about.",
                        "And the closer and closer the movie's release date drew, especially when pictures of Ben Platt in the role were released and he very clearly looked, um, not like a high school student, the more this film became a target of discourse and mockery. And with people surveying the upcoming film in this light also came a sort of revisiting of the musical in this discourse. So you'd see think pieces and videos and tweets that sort of tried to reconcile with this question of like was Dear Evan Hansen actually ever good or was it always just kinda bad and overrated from the start And I think that actually an interesting thing to briefly address because a movie that bad because it adapted its source material poorly isn't necessarily the same thing as a movie that's bad because, like, its source material is bad. One is the fault primarily of the source material, and the other is a failure to adapt it correctly.",
                        "So, was Dear Evan Hansen ever actually good? Both in the sense of being a good piece of art, and also in the sense of what it had to say about mental health. Eh. It was fine.",
                        "Like, it's not a bad show in any sense. Depending on which actor you see cast to play Evan, he can end up being a really compelling character. The way it depicts grief, and all the different ways it can manifest with songs like Requiem is quite well done, there are numbers that are cute and that are funny, and it manages to tell a pretty decent story. Especially good about the show is the relationship between Evan and his mom.",
                        "It manages to be a really good throughline. The show starts with both Evan and Connor's moms trying desperately to connect with their sons, and when Evan's lies come crashing down upon him, we are reminded of the fact that in many ways he is very much still a child through his connection with his mother. A rocky but nevertheless unconditional love that both imbues Evan with a strong sense of sympathy and humanity, and also showcases her own struggles to raise her son while having to provide for him, and also watching him navigate this world of, like, social media virality that she doesn't necessarily understand. I think the show also does a good job of addressing the insincerity and performativeness that come with a student's death at school, of people treating folks who have killed themselves less as their own individuals, and more as vessels to communicate their own beliefs, or to symbolize something in their own lives, or as tools to gain popularity.",
                        "There's a lot to like about this show, and I can easily understand why the most famous number from it, waving through a window, connected with and spoke to a lot of people. Just personally, I've seen it live a few times, and every time I have, I've enjoyed it, even if it wasn't the most life-changing thing that made me reconsider the theatre medium in a whole different way or anything like that. But it definitely has its weaknesses too. Some of it is just the inherent… okayness of the show.",
                        "There's nothing really interesting or memorable about, for example, most of the music, and some of the songs are just very nothing. To break in a glove, the song sung by the very important character of Connor's dad is the most frequently criticized for its boring and forgettable nature, but songs like Only Us suffer from the same problem of failing to be especially good. The show taps into certain themes that are really interesting, but fails to really explore them in their full depth. It's interesting to me that one of the things it got a lot of praise for when it first came out was its depiction of social media.",
                        "Because like, yeah, we do see that a little. Evan is successful at his Connor Project venture because a speech he gives at a memorial for Connor goes viral on YouTube. My speech? People started sharing it I guess, and now I mean Connor is everywhere.",
                        "Your speech is everywhere. This morning, the Connor Project page, it only had 56 people following it. How many does it have now? 4,580.",
                        "16,239! He is pushed to keep up the lie partly because a fundraiser in Connor's name starts, and the less he posts and continually makes stuff up about his relationship with Connor, the less likely it is to meet its goal. I think there is a lot to say with that about how we're incentivized to keep making content, even in cases where it's to the detriment of yourself or others. After what people believe to be Connor's note goes viral, his grieving family is essentially directly blamed for his death and end up receiving a number of abusive comments and phone calls online.",
                        "So it's definitely a present theme in the show, but it's very much only explored on a surface level. We don't get that much out of the depiction of social media, except that people are mean on it sometimes and going viral is weird. His internet fame doesn't really come up except in the context of getting fundraising money, and we don't really learn anything new about how he sees himself, or how it allows him to act and relate to others, or how the instantaneousness of it specifically compared to in a pre-social media age really affected his lie. It talks about social media, sure, but it doesn't really explore it in a particularly compelling way.",
                        "There are weird little mental health nuances that also don't really get explored in interesting ways. Evan goes off his meds after becoming popular at school and starting to date Zoe because, in his words, he doesn't need them anymore. And then the show just… never revisits it. And I personally have no problem with the show being about a person who fucks up and does bad things, and I also think if you watch the show he comes off as a lot more sympathetic and much more kind of accidentally pushed into the lie than if you just read a summary of it.",
                        "But it does at times struggle with how Evan and the other high schoolers are depicted in a mental health sense. One of the big critiques of Dear Evan Hansen is the idea that Evan isn't really sufficiently punished for the stuff he does. The show ends with the fundraiser having been successful, and having brought back this old apple orchard the real Connor used to love, and Zoe talking to Evan about the good that came from Evan's lie. So even though those two don't really talk anymore, there's still the tacit idea that what Evan did ultimately produced more good than bad, which is an interesting message.",
                        "I don't… really agree with this point about punishment. Mostly just because it doesn't have to be a morality play where ye all must come see evildoers punished for their wickedness, and also just because like, what do you want? He loses his girlfriend and doesn't get to reap any of the benefits from being a part of that family anymore. Do you want him to go to child jail too What?",
                        "But at the same time, it does kind of struggle with what it wants you to take away from Evan's actions. They're clearly depicted as in the wrong throughout the story, and it's very much beaten into the audience's head that Evan is doing a bad, just innately. But at the same time, the show shies clear of showing us any real, tangible ramifications for others besides some mean social media comments, which largely became a thing because of something Alana did, not something Evan did, and mostly just shows us the tangible good that came from Evan making Connor's story viral. Which is a shame because, again, there's a lot more they could get at with what that kind of social media exposure can do to a person, and they just don't.",
                        "And finally, there's the fact that, for all the show is marketed as this inspirational story about suicide and mental health and whatnot, all of the hashtag youwillbefound marketing, the actual death of Connor is really more a tangential plot device to a story which is fundamentally about Evan. Despite the story centering itself around Connor and his suicide, we see very little of him and what he and his life are actually like. And in some senses this is intentional. One of the things the show critiques is the way real mentally ill people's real deaths are exploited or weaponized or projected upon by others, often people who didn't really know these folks or care to.",
                        "But I think the message is weakened by the fact that the story itself also doesn't really care to learn much about Connor, or to meaningfully center or explore his own feelings and issues. Connor and his death end up being little more than storytelling devices to further center Evan, and that can get fairly uncomfortable on its own, and also confuse the message upon which the show markets itself. And then there's the character of Alana, who the show really struggles to make work. Alana is, depending on who you ask, either a bully who continually strong arms Evan into continuing the lie, going to some pretty terrible lengths that include publishing what she believes to be a suicide note against Evan's wishes, or she's a direct foil to Evan.",
                        "A depressed girl who, instead of withdrawing herself like Evan does, thrusts herself into every activity and extracurricular possible and yet is equally alone and desperate for friendship and recognition. And depending on how she's played, her character might steer closer to either reading of her, which is largely because she simply doesn't get a lot of focus from the narrative. Unlike Evan or Zoe or Connor or even the other side teen Jared who gets bits in Sincerely Me, she doesn't get anything resembling a song or a deeper look into her own feelings and motivations besides a couple of ambiguous throwaway lines, which leaves her character somewhere between either a minor villain or a character designed to parallel Evan's own mental health struggles. It's not that she necessarily needs to be a strictly good or bad person, but rather that Alana doesn't get enough depth or focus for either thing the writers were going for for her to really work.",
                        "And so to see Alana, who is also in many castings the only character of color in the show, be kind of uniquely sidelined in this way, kinda sucks. All this to say that Dear Evan Hansen is really… an okay show. There are some really good parts in it, and I can see why someone would love it, and there are also some pretty weak parts that make me understand why someone would either hate it or just not really feel much about it at all. It's, at least in my opinion, a safely mid-tier show.",
                        "One that could make a pretty decent movie if it played on its strengths, but at the same time, also with a lot of room for things to work on and adapt and improve for a future version of itself. So a Dear Evan Hansen film could very much be an opportunity to address some of those aforementioned story weaknesses, bulk out the stuff that works or needs more focus, and cut out the stuff that doesn't. But then, it wasn't that. And it was, um, very bad, and widely mocked.",
                        "And actually, it ended up doing the direct opposite of what it could have done. It cut out stuff that was desperately needed while adding things that some were bad and didn't work. So like I said a while back, this video isn't just about Dear Evan Hansen. I mean it is bad, and we are going to talk about that, but I want to look at it specifically from an adaptational standpoint.",
                        "Why this movie didn't work as an adaptation of a Broadway musical and what it can tell us about other adaptations and the task of doing that in general. Because taking a story that's designed to be told on stage, and especially one that's to be told with music and dancing and larger-than-life costumes designed to be visible from the back of a theatre and placing it into a much more contained and intimate medium-like film is always going to be a really big challenge. Which is why there's a massive litany of movie musicals out there that are safe to describe as like… pretty okay, but not as good as the original. But then, every once in a while, you get a Dear Evan Hansen.",
                        "And there's just so much here that's just really telling in terms of the entire process of taking a musical and making it a movie. Very much a what not to do situation. So for starters, let's talk about casting, and specifically how Dear Evan Hansen was cast, and why it's absolutely buckwild. I will say one single positive thing about the casting in the Dear Evan Hansen film, and that is the fact that James Corden is not in it.",
                        "Other than that, there's a lot to look at here. So Ben Platt being cast as Evan Hansen was one of the first announcements we heard from this film back in June 2020. And at the time, there wasn't really any big surprise at that revelation. He originated the role as far back as the very very start when the show was in its initial readings He performed it at the Tonys and he considered the iconic face of Dear Evan Hansen He played a high schooler in Ryan Murphy The Politician like a year prior.",
                        "His dad, Mark Platt, is a producer on the film. So yeah, it was gonna be Ben Platt who played Evan. And- okay, I know that it's not an especially hot or revelatory take at this point to point out the fact that he looks old in this movie, but holy fucking shit does he look old. The other actors cast to play high schoolers are, for the most part, also in their mid to late twenties.",
                        "Like, this is very standard for Hollywood at this point, but for the most part, they mostly look like high schoolers. Or at the very least, what we've convinced ourselves in our head from watching a bunch of these movies that high schoolers kinda sorta look like. Something that both makes Ben Platt look extremely out of place, and also makes the romance scenes between Evan and a much younger looking Zoe just feel intensely creepier. And it's also the fact that Ben Platt doesn't really look that old normally, but they gave him this weird haircut and lit him poorly, and so it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to age him like the end of Harry Potter.",
                        "Also, side note, but the projector in the theatre my co-writer Emily saw this movie in was calibrated poorly and washed everything out and made Ben Platt's face look weirdly paler like polymer eraser white, which just made him look even more like a strange little freak. But the thing is, this isn't just a problem in the sense that it looks goofy and funny. It actually fucks with a really significant element of what makes this show mostly work on stage, and makes the entire story much harder to swallow. The original musical, for all its flaws and how exactly it depicts Evan and his actions, gives you a sort of understanding as to how an extremely socially anxious suicidal kid with no real sense of assertiveness or self-esteem could end up getting trapped in a lie because he was too anxious to say something.",
                        "Evan is immature, but his immaturity is a function of his age. We see Evan generally not as a mustache-twirling manipulator, but as a kid who fucked up. When we see Evan on stage, we judge him as we would judge a teenager. When he lays his head on his mother's lap and finally gets to stop lying, we see that relief, and we see that as bad as he's done and as much as he needs to make amends, he's ultimately still a scared, mentally ill kid.",
                        "He's literally neurodivergent and a minor. But when we're looking at a now-pushing-30 Ben Platt on camera and seeing the way he interacts with the world, it becomes painfully clear that we are watching, and judging, an adult man. All of Evan Hansen's immaturities and teenage faults are now deeply incongruous with what we are seeing on screen, and therefore become less understandable to us and more so deeply inappropriate. And this again especially makes the romance section feel a lot more manipulative and a lot more calculated, and so we spend a lot of the show not empathizing with Ben Platt as intended and understanding how his own problems brought him this far and what it's done to him and others, but instead just being horrified that we're watching a serial killer origin story set to upbeat pop music.",
                        "And the thing is, this is partly an issue of the translation between stage and screen. Besides the fact that Evan Hansen's Broadway actors are already usually cast to be pretty young like it generally tends to be actors in their early 20s playing Evan Hansen, you also can get away with a lot more looseness in your casting when you're on stage based on the inherent fantasy of what a stage show is. is. Everyone understands when they go see a staged production that the things happening on stage are to some extent non-literal representations of the story. So this is a really minor example, but the Dear Evan Hansen stage has a screen where social media posts will pop up throughout the show.",
                        "This is obviously like a metaphorical representation of social media- the characters aren't literally having other people's Facebook posts blasted on a screen in front of them at their school. It's there for the benefit of the audience, convey what's happening in a non-literal way. Or even take a show like Hamilton, which, for all its faults, is still relevant to discuss when we're talking about what can and can't happen on stage. The way ensemble members manifest, sometimes as audience stand-ins, sometimes as historical onlookers, and sometimes as deeper representations of things inside the characters, like their guilt, isn't literal.",
                        "There isn't literally a group of people screaming no, no, no at Alexander Hamilton when he's about to cheat on his wife. Basically, when you enter a staged space, you implicitly recognize that elements of it are going to be larger than life and that these things will act as stand-ins for different things. Which is why, for example, an older actor can act as a representation of a younger character, and it doesn't necessarily matter very much. Half the ensemble members in Matilda are children, and half of them, the ones doing the more complicated choreography are adults, and it doesn't matter or look weird because we're pulled into the metaphorical space of Matilda.",
                        "Or even going outside age. The costumes in The Lion King aren't just fursuits designed to look like hyper-realistic lions, they're a mix of literal masks and puppeteering to convey the image of the animal they're representing, but also just clothing and costumes that get at the character's personality and feeling rather than an attempt to look like a literal lion. How a character looks in a Broadway show is often non-literal, and that's recognized and understood by audiences. So if Ben Platt is a bit older than he used to be in the role, it's not really that big of a deal because we're already suspending visual disbelief by stepping into the space.",
                        "The second reason is a lot more basic. Generally speaking, audience members at live shows aren't seeing actors in high definition. They'll be seated many feet away, even in the best best most expensive seats and sometimes an entire room away if you in the nosebleeds It just a lot less weird and noticeable for a somewhat older actor to stand on stage live than it is when you getting these close on their face in a movie theatre and every single wrinkle is on full display. Film is not only a typically much more literal representation of what we're seeing, which is why if they make a Matilda movie musical, adults playing elementary school students and hanging out with them on screen would look really fucking weird, but you also just get a much better look at people, seeing them up close, and in a much more grounded and realistic setting.",
                        "So when you're making a movie, whether it's with age or other physical traits about the musical characters, you need to be a lot more careful about the realism of whatever it is you're depicting. If you don't want whatever you're depicting in film to involve that kind of realism, it's going to take a lot more active effort because otherwise that's typically just the default of that medium. And when this falls apart for any reason, it's much more noticeable and problematic in film. Unless you're doing something like Mamma Mia, which just doesn't give a shit and doesn't pretend to give a shit, if your actors look slightly off for the part, it's incredibly obvious.",
                        "Meryl Streep is obviously an amazing actor, but the way she was cast and styled in something like Into the Woods, which is my favourite musical and I feel very strongly about this, just doesn't work in the the more toned down, grounded approach it has on film compared to stage. Look at Bernadette Peters' costuming and prosthetics used to make her look like this cartoonish old witch lady, and you can see how big and dramatic that shift later is when she's transformed back into a beautiful woman. That big shift probably wouldn't work as well in live action film just in general because of the cartoonishness of it, but they try to resolve this in the film with a much more realistic witch, and that makes the big transformation look like very… nothing. Like, she just has neater hair and slightly fewer wrinkles and bags under her eyes.",
                        "She didn't need to send everyone in her little magic village on a fetch quest for beauty, she could just brush her hair and put a bit of foundation on and she would look the exact same. And the fact that we are looking at her up close throughout every scene she's in in this film means that we can tell, extremely fucking well, the differences in that transformation are, and so necessarily we judge it in the context of its realism. In terms of casting for the rest of Dear Evan Hansen, it's for the most part fine. There were some criticisms that I frankly don't feel the most qualified to go super in depth to about Amandla Stenberg's casting as Alana, as often it is a dark-skinned actor playing that role on stage and there aren't a lot of roles for dark-skinned women.",
                        "But other than their casting, everyone is ranging from passable to pretty good at their job. Amy Adams and Julianne Moore are doing their best despite their reduced roles in the show, Caitlin Dever is as good an actor as any as Zoe, and the Connor and the Jared are mostly fine. This is a cast that theoretically should be able to carry the story despite the unfortunate inclusion as a poorly styled Ben Platt of Evan. But so much of the story still hinges on Evan.",
                        "Very much, more than it is a story about Connor or Evan's mom or the Murphys or anyone else. This is about Evan and his own mental health. And so when virtually everything he does in this show comes off as deranged because we no longer understand him as a mentally ill teen who stumbled into the lie, and when we are therefore constantly pulled out of getting any real investment in the story because we're distracted by how just fucking weird and out of place Evan Hansen looks, we can't necessarily get as invested in any parts of the story at all in the way that we could on stage. But even in scenes that aren't largely about Evan, like in the Requiem scene, we still can't get fully invested in the story, and that's because the faults of this film go beyond just who is acting in it.",
                        "Another really key element to making Broadway work on film is what you do with the music, And the film unfortunately fucks this up too. So something that's just become accepted as a thing that happens when musicals get adapted to film is that, generally speaking, two things are going to happen. You are going to lose some of the songs from the stage version, and there is always going to be at least one new song written specifically for the movie musical. So for example, you have Suddenly, the one that Valjean sings to Gazette when they're the wagon together, or you have all the new songs in those live action Disney adaptations like Evermore and Beauty and the Beast, or the Girlboss song in Aladdin, or fucking Beautiful Ghosts from the Cats movie.",
                        "And generally speaking, this is just something you're going to have to expect in a film adaptation. And in all fairness, these aren't always bad songs. Mean Green Mother from Outer Space was written for the film adaptation of Little Shop of Horrors, and it's now considered an iconic part of the musical. Or Ladies' Choice, written for the Hairspray movie, manages to be pretty catchy and give Zac Efron more of a chance to sing.",
                        "But these are generally known for being kind of forgettable and kind of… cynical. Part of it is that everyone knows the real reason these songs tend to be added to the films is so they can vie for award nominations and get wins for Best Original Song. Which you know is fine. If they want to write a nice song and get awards for it, sure.",
                        "But it always feels so disingenuous when you then hear Tom Hooper go on about how acknowledging that Jean Valjean likes being a dad was missing from his journey before, and how there were these deep gaps in the original that only a new song could fill, and it's kind of like, come on. We all know that that is absolutely never the real reason. It sucks. But it can also have the effect of these songs feeling one, really shoehorned into awkward places in the story, and two, the songs being very generic.",
                        "That was one of the biggest criticisms of the songs in The Greatest Showman. It was a musical that felt like it hated being a musical and the bland songs with generic lyrics about romance and whatnot really didn help Oftentimes these added songs don tend to really reference the characters or story in the way the other songs in the show do but rather seem to exist specifically to be listened to outside of the context of the show. To have pop covers and be streamed all the time, to sound inspirational and make money, rather than to actually fit well into the show. That's why most of the time when you go see a movie musical, even if you're not super familiar with the original music, it tends to be incredibly easy to point out which song was added later.",
                        "But in the case of Dear Evan Hansen, they did actually have a real opportunity here with Alana. This is a character who doesn't get that much exploration or development in the original show, who there's clearly a lot of potential to further explore. She's the only one of the five named teenage characters who doesn't really sing that much, and we don't learn much about her. So giving Alana her own song could actually really work out in the film's favour.",
                        "Unfortunately… this doesn't. So Amandla Stenberg actually wrote the song Alana gets in the movie called The Anonymous Ones. It expands a little bit on Alana's own mental health, referencing how she needs medication to function, and is basically about the idea that lots of people go unnoticed and slip through the cracks, and it's kind of just thematically an expanded version of waving through a window. It shows that Evan isn't the only one suffering in this way.",
                        "In terms of that message, you kind of already get that with You Will Be Found, but the primary purpose of the Anonymous Ones really is to expand a bit on Alana's character where we didn't see much of it in the show. So in order to understand what doesn't work here, we need to look at the way Stenberg plays Alana. I'm not really sure how much of this was their own choice and how much of this was how they were told to play it, but I'm assuming this was mostly a directing decision because it's a problem with basically all of the line delivery in the film. I'll talk about this more in depth later, but pretty much every line in the film, including ones directly from the show that were played out in a comedic context, is delivered in the most dour, depressing way possible.",
                        "Everyone is quiet and sad when they meet each other in the hallways or talk about their mental health, and so lines from the show that read as jokes now are just played straight and very depressingly. They even cut a line from one of the songs where Evan accidentally stumbles on his words and something comes out really wrong, which is a cute little joke that's just not in the film. He thought you looked really pretty or it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. He did?",
                        "He thought it looked pretty cool when you put indigo streaks in your hair. But Alana as a character especially suffers from this. In the show, especially at the beginning, she carries a very upbeat, involved energy. For the three of you watching who know who Mira is, it's very Mira.",
                        "So what we get at when we see little slivers of the way she talks and acts later in the show, although it's not hugely expanded upon, is that this is a character who uses clubs and achievements and high grades in order to cope with a deep sense of loneliness. Hey, how was your summer? Mine was productive. I did three internships and 90 hours of community service.",
                        "The idea is that Alana is not a person you would expect to be depressed, unlike someone like Evan, whose anxiety is, well, very noticeable. But the issue with the way this film presents Alana is that now, every single time she speaks to Evan or gives a speech to the school, she doesn't sound like she's even trying to be upbeat. There's no moment of the mask slipping and making us reconsider our perspective on what a depressed person looks like, because she seems exceptionally sad every single time she delivers a line. Phenomenal, really.",
                        "You know what's not phenomenal? Deforestation. Um, so to explain what we're going to be asking of you, I'm going to turn things over to our director of global communications. Well, the thing about the emails is just that, like, you and Conner keep talking about climbing this tree together in June.",
                        "We were in school in June. So for Alana to have this scene and this entire musical number where she talks to Evan and goes, hey, I know no one suspects this about me and nobody knows this, but I'm actually really sad a lot of the time, doesn't work because it's like, really? No one would suspect that a character who delivers every line like it's the saddest thing they've heard ever is sad? It's really disappointing, actually, that we don't get the opportunity to learn more about Alana and maybe her home life and her own struggles because that was missing in the original show.",
                        "And we do have one of those rare opportunities here where adding a show to a movie musical would actually fill a gap in the original. It's just disappointing, in all honesty. But The Anonymous Ones doesn't only exist as an attempt to expand upon Alana's story and or win Best Original Song. It also serves to replace a couple songs from the show that were removed in the film.",
                        "This is a tough position to tackle when you're adapting a musical for the screen. On top of being chock full of songs, another thing about Broadway musicals is that they tend to be very long. You tend to be in for a two and a half hour experience, a little less without the intermission, and the idea is that you are going to get your money's worth. So when you're adapting something like that to screen, it's not surprising that, oftentimes, certain songs are just going to have to get cut.",
                        "Or sometimes there are songs that might not necessarily work as well on stage as they do in a film. I'm gonna talk to you in a bit about an entire musical that just probably never should have been a film because there's no real good way imaginable that you could have pulled it off. Or sometimes certain songs are just bad. The fact that the song Mooning isn't in the Grease movie is not some horrible travesty.",
                        "But these things don't just affect the cast recording or the numbers or any of that. You can't get rid of or modify songs that having an effect on the story, and a lot of the time that effect is negative. Generally speaking, music isn't thrust haphazardously into a show with no consideration for when a song should exist or why. Unless a musical is totally sung through like Les Mis or Hamilton, songs are placed at specific points in the story, with the most common adage about it being you sing when you can no longer speak.",
                        "These tend to be points of heightened emotion that are either personally important to the characters or just important to the broader story. So, for example, in Dear Evan Hansen, the song Requiem isn't just in there because it sounds pretty. Requiem is about all three of Connor's surviving relatives having different perspectives on how to grieve Connor, things none of them are willing or able to talk about with one another yet. So watching each of them, on their own, singing their verses about their complicated feelings on their son's death, furthers our understanding of these characters in a way you can't necessarily get with dialogue.",
                        "The song is really important, and it's important that that is a song. Or take the Into the Woods movie. God, I hate that movie. I hate that movie so much.",
                        "Horrible adaptation of absolutely incredible source material. In terms of toning down a lot of the themes and darker elements of the show and just making it like, ooooh, pretty fairy tale, they also cut the entire subplot with the baker and his father and most of the Rapunzel stuff. So for those of you who haven't seen Into the Woods, which is I'm assuming most people, one of the themes is that the witch in this story, who is one of the best characters in anything ever and I love her, basically locks Rapunzel, her adoptive daughter- I guess adoptive is a weird word- her kidnapped daughter- in a tower for most of her life, something we later see in the show explicitly traumatizes her and makes her unable to interact normally with other people and later even leads to her dying. This is unsurprisingly not in the film because it is a Disney movie and they're not going to kill off one of their princesses, so she's just barely in it and then she just leaves.",
                        "And the baker, one of the leads, is also struggling to process the death of his wife while also parenting a newborn baby and is tempted to just walk away from the responsibility of being a parent. And then he has this song conversation with his own father, who did exactly that, walked away from being a parent, and it's kind of about breaking the cycle and making the choice to be better, and again, really important that this is a song. The film, by cutting these songs out, and therefore by cutting both subplots, are essentially erasing an entire theme of the show, which is largely about how we are shaped by the way we're raised, and the way trauma can be passed on, and our responsibility to our children. So at the end of the movie, when they're all singing like, be careful the things you say, children will listen, it really rings hollow because like, what the fuck are they talking about?",
                        "What does this have to do with anything we just watched in this movie? Why are we singing about how we raise our children all of a sudden? This is especially salient given that the show's creator, Stephen Sondheim, was himself a survivor of parental abuse and emotional neglect, and large portions of the story are explicitly a reflection on this and on the consequences on our own childhoods. In many ways, this theme is the show.",
                        "My point is that cutting songs from musicals is often a necessary thing, but it's also a very risky one. You risk either taking moments of heightened emotion and reducing their importance to the story, or just disregarding key themes from the narrative you're trying to tell. All this doesn't mean you should never cut certain numbers from a show, but rather that you need to be conscious about what you're cutting and why, and what, if anything, you replace it with. And once again, Dear Evan Hansen does not do that.",
                        "So, to break in a glove, the shitty, boring song that has Evan, who never really knew his dad, bonding with Connor's conservative wasp dad gets cut, which is fine, no one liked that song anyway. But they also cut the opening song of the musical, the one that sets the tone for the entire thing, Does Anybody Have a Map? And this song is basically showcasing Evan's mom and Connor's mom at the same time, and their own struggles trying to connect with their kids. It serves a few purposes.",
                        "For one, it centers Evan's mother Heidi as an important character whose own struggles and worries we see beyond just being a mom whose job is mom. It lets us see more of Connor and how he relates to his family and what his home life was like, which is important given how little Connor as Connor actually features in this show. It establishes a central theme of the musical, which is that as much as the Hanson family and the Murphy family exist within different structures and different socioeconomic classes, their struggles with their children are fundamentally the same. The moms are singing the same words at the same time for a reason.",
                        "And cutting it, instead opening right with Evan singing waving through a window, really reduces the importance of these themes. Also, just from a nitpicky theatre nerd perspective, you don't open with the I Want song. The I Want song is almost always the second, or sometimes third song in the show, because generally speaking, songs that exist to establish the world and the stakes come first for a reason. You can't have a How Far I'll Go without having a Where You Are.",
                        "You can't I have confidence without how do you solve a problem like Maria. You need to establish who or what the world is before it matters what a character wants or feels within its constraints. Just fucking hell. But in particular, the way this, and the film in general, cuts down on Evan's relationship with his mom is a real problem.",
                        "Because on top of cutting Does Anybody Have a Map, they also cut Good For You, one of the best and actually most important songs in the show Good For You serves a crucial narrative purpose At this point we reach the part in the story where Evan is starting to get wrapped up in his lies. He's moved from being someone to whom the lies kind of accidentally happened, to someone who is actively making the choice to keep telling them, because the benefits he gets from it are making him feel good. His relationship with Zoe is going great. He keeps going over to the Murphys' house and basically treating them as surrogate parents, and as a result, he's neglecting his role in the charity he helped start, he's neglecting his friendship with Jared, and he's neglecting his relationship with his actual mother.",
                        "The Murphys even offer to pay for him to go off to university- something that makes his own mom Heidi feel extremely embarrassed and belittled. And Evan is extremely on board with this- something that we as the audience know is built on the lies he is now actively choosing to continually tell to this family. And so Good For You is the number where Alana, Jared, and most importantly Heidi are basically singing this to him. They're talking about how Evan is treating them as disposable.",
                        "How he's only being with these people to the extent that he can use them for personal gain. Jared, with whom he fabricates the emails, is only being treated as a vessel for Evan to keep lying. His mom is someone to be discarded in favor of this new surrogate family he's found for himself. Alana is left with the burden of maintaining a charity based on Evan's lies all by herself.",
                        "The song is important for several reasons. For one, it's one of the few times people's feelings other than Evan's are explicitly centered in the voice of the show. We get to see, viscerally, how Evan's actions are affecting other people all at once. It's a good way of showing how in-deep Evan has gotten.",
                        "They are trying in this song to urge him back to doing the right thing, and it isn't working. There's even a section that shows how desperately Evan has dug himself into this hole, and the fact that he doesn't really seem to want to get out of it. And it also, once again, deepens the importance of the character of Heidi. She's more than just a mom figure who exists solely to provide emotional comfort to Evan.",
                        "It shows the way she is deeply affected by his actions. And even just from an Evan standpoint, Heidi is a very humanizing part of Evan's story. Even while he is behaving very unethically, the strong ties between Evan and his mom make Evan a more sympathetic person. It makes his breakdown, where he just needs his mom to comfort him, where he needs a love that is unconditional, feel much more real.",
                        "And to reduce Heidi to a very limited character whose only job is just to be mom and to replace everything in Good For You with like a two minute argument scene is strongly to this show's detriment. There's also… another song that they technically add toward the end, and I'll get to that one in a second because that's more of a storytelling issue than a music issue. But on the whole, the way they chose to distribute these songs, what was kept and what was cut in the story, really acted to its detriment. And I think this, and other failures to cut things properly like we saw in Into the Woods, reflects an improper understanding of what a musical is and what a musical is fundamentally supposed to do.",
                        "I did a whole video on this as it pertained to musical episodes of non-musical TV shows, but essentially, musical numbers are a very deliberate choice that serve a unique narrative purpose. And so you need to be equally careful and equally deliberate when cutting things out or bringing new elements in. And we very much did not get that here. In terms of musicals being much longer than their film counterparts most of the time, that adaptational element also tends to demand changes to the actual story.",
                        "And that's, again, just a necessary thing. Film is a different medium and has different focus and different time constraints, so it's not necessarily a problem that, say, there's a fuckton of new dialogue in In the Heights, or that Tracy doesn't go to jail in the Hairspray movie, or actually a very good change in Hairspray was having Inez win the competition instead of Tracy, scripting changes are natural in shows, especially when there were issues in the original, or just things that wouldn't translate well to film. And that's the thing- Dear Evan Hansen has a lot of problems, and it's already faced a lot of criticism for how it's handled its subject matter. So the film definitely served as an opportunity to reframe some of the elements in the original that didn't necessarily work to its advantage.",
                        "And to its credit, it does try. It does attempt to reconcile with some of the more criticized parts of its stage counterpart. Unfortunately, it seems to have just worsened every single aspect of it. Beyond the omission of certain songs and the inclusion of a new one, there are other changes to the script that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things, but really add up.",
                        "Let's just start with the most basic one. Jared, Evan's sarcastic friend, is made gay in this version. This sure is a choice that is made. I'm not quite sure why it was made, beyond the fact that this was simply a popular headcanon for the character.",
                        "There is a more cynical interpretation, which is that this was done in response to the fact that there isn't an actual canon gay character in the play, and considering how many people do think the play is about gay lovers, and considering that there's an entire song that can be boiled down to essentially no homo jokes, yeah, I could imagine it would feel weird without any sort of actual LGBTQ representation. I rub my nipples and start glowing with delight. How did you write that? There's nothing unrealistic about the law of one man heels for another.",
                        "Has been rough. But not because we're gay. No, not because we're gay. But not that way The only man that I love is my dad And yeah sure enough not only is Jared gay here but they also give him the line but not because they gay which sure Giving the only gay character the previously no homo line is… the choice.",
                        "This also comes with the unintentional side effect where the only known gay character in the film is the selfish jerk who openly insults Evan at every point and makes unwarranted sexual comments over and over again, which is also a choice. But perhaps the most blatant scripting change is to the ending. As mentioned earlier, one of the biggest issues people had with the stage version was feeling like Evan got off too easy at the end of it. That there should have been more consequences to his actions.",
                        "Additionally, there's also the criticism that the stage musical isn't really about Connor, and instead uses the suicide of this teenager primarily as a plot device to explore other characters. So the filmmakers decided to change the ending of the movie in order to essentially address both criticisms at the same time. And it doesn't really help, like… at all. So in the stage show, the Murphys find out about what Evan did, but they all keep it secret.",
                        "Nobody else ever finds out the truth, the apple orchard successfully reopens, and Zoe and Evan essentially reconcile enough to have a calm discussion about what all happened. The film tries to fix this by having Evan admit to lying about everything on his Instagram page. I was never friends with Connor Murphy. I lied.",
                        "Repeatedly. And then, in order to hopefully gain a more accurate perspective of Connor, he messages anyone he can on Connor's Facebook page until he finds someone who went to rehab with Connor, who gives Evan a video of Connor performing a song he wrote while in the clinic. Evan then distributes a USB containing the footage to Connor's loved ones and people involved in the Connor project, and that's when we then time skip a year later to the Apple Orchard conversation with Zoe and Evan. On the surface, this seems like an okay change, but in actual execution, it fixes… basically nothing.",
                        "Part of the problem is that in the grand scheme of things, nothing about the ending is fundamentally different. Evan coming clean about everything is nice and all, especially if you're someone bothered by the fact that the truth never came out in the musical, but we don't ever actually see any of the consequences of Evan's revelation. Nothing substantial at least, no deep insight into how this affects his life, or changes the way people see him, or treat him, or anything long term. they simply say that it is a thing that has now happened. And the rest of the ending plays out as normal, with Zoe still forgiving Evan and the apple orchard still opening.",
                        "It feels like a change there not because they want to explore that idea of what if Evan came clean to everyone, but because they want people to be able to cross off the list and say yep, that happened, he did finally reveal himself. As for the Connor stuff, once again this seems like an okay change on paper. It's trying to adjust the ending to be more about Connor and focus on the actual person at the end of the day. Showing stuff that was only mentioned in the show, like Evan finding a list of Connor's favourite books and going through them to understand him better, is a good call.",
                        "Even if it does mean watching Evan read Ready Player One to understand a dead kid. But it just like, rings so hollow. The new song they gave to Connor, A Little Closer, is uh… Sorry if this makes me come off poorly, but it's really bad. It's a really generic song.",
                        "It tells us nothing about him as a person, or anything that makes him unique. Just this standard, inspirational acoustic guitar piece fresh out of a Baptist youth sermon. And the thing is that despite this attempt, the movie is weirdly even less about Connor than the stage show is. Like, Connor in the musical gets a fair bit more to do than the film.",
                        "As previously mentioned, we have the opening number, which gives us a glimpse into Connor's home life, his relationship to his sister and his parents, and his overall personality. It's not much, but it gives us a direct, objective view of what Connor's day-to-day life was like while he was still around. But then even after Connor dies, he still manages to stick around for the rest of the time. I don't know if there's a better way to phrase this, except to say that, metaphorically, Connor's ghost basically acts as Evan's subconscious throughout the stage show, occasionally popping up to ask him ethical questions and challenge him on what he's doing and do a reprise of Sincerely Me about sex acts you do in rehab.",
                        "Because like what's the point of having a whole actor for Connor and just having him for the first 15 minutes of the show? You gotta get your money's worth. Keep bringing the kid out on stage, even if he's dead. I mean, to be fair, they did the same thing in Heather's.",
                        "She just fucking dies in the movie because it's film. You can just tell your actor to go home. But in the musical, she pops up as a ghost. She's Veronica's conscience.",
                        "You do that. You do that on stage. Classic difference of mediums. I hit my mic.",
                        "But in all seriousness, what this means is that even though we're not seeing the actual Connor in life and in action, and we are seeing Evan's internal conception of Connor, his presence is still felt throughout the show. Whenever he shows up again, it's a reminder that yes, this is who this whole thing is about. This is the kid who's getting lost in the lying and the chaos. The movie drops this entirely.",
                        "I get why. Having scenes where Connor's ghost appears and challenges Evan would be super weird to show on screen, and would also probably pad out the screen time too much. But what this means is that after his brief scene in the library, and then the musical number Sincerely Me, Connor just disappears from the show. People talk about him, sure, but we don't really see him nor do we get a lot of interesting details about him or a sense of who he is The way they feature Connor in the film he might as well have just been a lamp that broke and shattered that everyone is now sad about That why this changed ending with the new song rings so hollow They took out a significant portion of this character's presence and identity from the show and replaced it with a generic acoustic radio hit.",
                        "And it's a reminder that at the end of the day, this movie actually isn't about Connor because the ending wasn't changed to place more emphasis on him, but rather to create more of a redemption arc for Evan. Even in the revision, this film is still prioritizing Evan's emotions and journey rather than Connor's, and it makes the whole thing feel significantly scummier. It makes the film feel less like it's trying to tell the story of Dear Evan Hansen, and more like the film is supposed to be an apology for the story of Dear Evan Hansen. But not even a good apology, one of those ones where someone is like, I am very sorry if you were offended by my words.",
                        "The way that the film is written, the changes and alterations it makes to the source material, which already had issues to begin with, makes the film seem way more hollow and way more mean and impersonal than its stage counterpart. But hey, you know, just because the script is shitty doesn't mean that the movie can't be good. Lots of shitty scripts can be saved through execution and good direction, especially musicals. So, um, how good is Evan Hansen's directing?",
                        "Perhaps one of the most important parts of a stage-to-screen conversion is one of the ones that you don't really think about. And admittedly, that's because most people don't think about it in general. Cinematography, staging, and blocking are some of the great invisible magics of the art form. Things like acting and music and dialogue are all flashy and in your face.",
                        "They're things you can easily notice and observe and comment on regardless of your knowledge of the medium or any greater theory. It's pretty easy to tell how a certain casting choice affects the film, or if a song is performed well, or if a line of dialogue is good or bad. But generally speaking, things like blocking and cinematography are sort of meant to be invisible. Unless something is actively trying to be noticeable, chances are you aren't going to notice, the same way you might not notice exactly what you're doing with your hands in a certain moment, or where you are relative to the door in your room.",
                        "It's also the moment where a lot of movie musicals really, really mess up, especially recently. You see, as we've kind of talked about throughout the video, film and theatre are two different mediums and by extension have two different languages. Things that work on stage won't necessarily work on screen and vice versa. A lot of this is a difference in perceived realism.",
                        "In a stage production, you don't necessarily need to believe that the space people are occupying is a real space because, well, you'd know it's not. You're there observing a performance. You are watching people perform in a box in front of you. They exist in the same physical space that you do.",
                        "That means that a lot of the staging and production of stage shows are more… abstract, I guess is the best word. They can play around more with the environment, such as how Hamilton's set is a mostly static wooden room with a few props brought in every now and then. You can play with time, like having a character finish one scene and then transition into another scene without that character leaving the stage at all, or anything else that would give the theoretical idea of a scene ending. Think of how Come From Away has most of its cast on stage for the entirety of its show and just transitions effortlessly between moment to moment.",
                        "But I think one of the most important things unique to theatre is the way that a character interacts with the fourth wall. The fourth wall thing is quite interesting because it's a small matter that really does have a large effect on the overall perception of the work. For those who don't know, the fourth wall in a stage production refers to the fourth wall that would exist in a set. Considering how theatre has to be observable and cheated out toward an audience, rooms can't be closed and contained the same way they are in real life.",
                        "So a room in a stage show has a back wall, two side walls, and nothing else. What would be the fourth wall is the audience. And in a stage show, you can easily play with that. Because there is the unavoidable perception that this is all being performed to a crowd, you can simply have your actors, well, perform to the crowd.",
                        "I don't necessarily mean direct interactions, like calling out to them or mingling with them the way a musician might at a concert, though that certainly could happen, but it's more that because of the fact that you're aware you're being performed to, the actor, if they wanted to, could just stand there and, well, perform to you. No need for a lot of stage business, or sometimes even a background. You can just have the characters sing to the crowd amongst an empty backdrop and you're fine and it gets the job done and it works. But that doesn't work in a film.",
                        "Not really. The problem is that while the fourth wall in a stage show is the audience, the fourth wall in a film is the camera. And then later the audience will watch what the camera captured. And because of our underlying notion of cameras and how they work and what their purpose is, we generally expect them to record something matching close to reality.",
                        "I don't mean that that we expect everything that we see on film to actually be capable of happening in real life. Like, it's not like we're all watching Dune and going, this is bullshit. Worms aren't actually that big. However, there is this sort of idea that what we're seeing in frame is something that exists in the world of that frame, and that the world of that frame needs to seem like enough of a believable world to us.",
                        "It's generally why you don't see as much abstraction in film as you do in theatre, at least outside of art films. It's also why effects and props tend to get called out for not looking realistic more in film than they do in theatre. Unless it's like that weird bone saw inflatable that they used in Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark, what the fuck was that? The ways in which the language of the two mediums differ is honestly the root cause for a lot of the adaptational issues that you see in a lot of terrible musical movies.",
                        "If there's any style of theatre that takes full advantage of the abstract nature of the stage, it's musicals, and trying to figure out how to convert that into a film with different standards and understandings of how everything should be presented is… challenging. One of the ways this difference manifests itself, and a way in which it's especially noticeable in Dear Evan Hansen, is the way both stories convey the passage of time. The stage musical really wants to make it clear to the audience that Evan's lie, at least at the beginning, wasn't really something he deliberately set out to create. It was him not wanting to speak up in an awkward situation and correct a pair of grieving parents, and then it snowballed out of control from there.",
                        "And one of the things this show does do well is to convey the passage of time. Sets and characters often move around Evan who is the centerpiece, so once he's finished keeping up one aspect of his ruse, he's immediately onto the next thing. Evan is spending time with Zoe, and then immediately afterward, Alana is urging him to keep sharing his email exchanges with Connor. Or Evan is with his mom Heidi, and then the world moves around him, and immediately he's back visiting the Murphy family again, living in the temporary lie of a supportive, wealthy, nuclear family.",
                        "In a lot of ways, this conveys the exact same feeling Evan has- that he has no control over his life, that things happen to him. But in the film, that sense of momentum is no longer present. Characters and sets can't just move around Evan to keep up that feeling of constant pressure and snowballing. Instead, when we keep cutting to him going from his house to school to the Murphy home, it becomes a lot more grounded in our minds, and a lot more clear to us that like, this sense of constant action happening to Evan isn't really what we're seeing here.",
                        "There are long stretches of time between the things Evan does, and he keeps just choosing to go over and hang out at the Murphys when really, he could stop at any time. Along with the casting, and along with the musical changes, and along with the scripting changes, this is yet another reason we find it extremely difficult to relate to and sympathize with Evan, and another reason why he comes off as a fucking serial killer. The heightened, dramatic, very metaphorical tension around time and how Evan responds to it can't really work on film in the same way that it does on stage. Which means, when you're adapting it, if you want to convey that same feeling of things just snowballing out of control, you need to make certain changes to the way it's directed or what exactly happens in it in order to translate that feeling to a more grounded medium.",
                        "But by and large, Dear Evan Hansen just doesn't do that, and so we end up watching and judging Evan a lot more harshly than we would when we see him on stage. This is a challenge directors face a lot when they're trying to translate metaphorical or simplified versions of a staged story onto screen. You can't necessarily create the same non-literal visual shorthand as you can on stage, but at the same time, too much realism can actually weaken what a story is trying to do. I think the perfect example of this in action is The Last Five Years.",
                        "For those who don't know, The Last Five Years is a semi-autobiographical musical by Twitter name searcher Jason Robert Brown chronicling the relationship and eventual breakup of two people. Jamie, a self-absorbed asshole writer, and Kathy, a woman with anxiety and insecurity issues who needs more time and respect than what Jamie is willing to provide to her because he just didn't listen to anything and always put his needs before hers and… sorry, sorry, my co-writer Emily went through a breakup while writing this script, I don't know if you can tell. There are two things that make the last five years stand out. The first being that it's told from a non-linear perspective.",
                        "Jamie's side of the story is told in chronological order, starting with the two meeting and ending with him leaving her, while Kathy's side of the story is told in reverse, starting with Jamie leaving her and ending with the two meeting for the first time. The second thing that makes it stand out is, well, the fact that it's even split up into two sides to begin with. With the exception of one number toward the middle where the two stories sync up chronologically, Jamie and Kathy are never on stage at the same time. Essentially all the songs are solos, there is no ensemble, just one of the actors on stage singing about the relationship and then when they're done they tag out and the other actor comes in to do their song.",
                        "This is important to the way the last five years feels. For starters, it contributes to the feeling of disconnect between Jamie and Kathy. Considering how the musical starts with the revelation that these two won't actually end up together, having them have limited onstage interaction takes away a lot of feelings of intimacy the couple could have, and I mean that in the best of ways. It makes it especially clear, not just through the lyrics themselves but via the physical presentation of them, that there is an intense split and difference in how the two experience things.",
                        "And that's another reason it works so well. By dividing the two characters up, making it so that only one of them sings to the audience at a time, it reinforces the idea that what you're being presented is simply the perspective of the person singing at the time, rather than the actual objective truth of what was going on. Theoretically speaking, the point of the last five years is that by showing how each person saw the good and bad parts of that relationship, you understand both people's strengths and flaws, and also how they both contributed to the marriage not working. I say theoretically.",
                        "Jamie does a lot more blatantly terrible things throughout the show which are easier to point to and go, yeah, that's pretty fucked up. But for the most part, it does work out. Kathy will sing about frustrations with her career and feeling like Jamie is neglecting her and her interests, and then Jamie will come and sing about how hard it is to try and support her and be hit with a brick wall. Kathy will sing about how Jamie's success makes him too busy and makes her feel neglected, while Jamie will sing about how stressful trying to manage being a successful author is, and how terrible it can feel to have his wife seemingly judge him for trying to advance his career.",
                        "It's some honestly really interesting stuff, and despite some flaws and warts, The Last 5 Years is generally a good stage show, and I do recommend checking it out. But then in 2014, they decided to do a movie adaptation of it for… some reason. The film, starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan showcases a lot of the issues that come up with translating a work like this to film And the thing that makes it so interesting is that there really isn anything garishly bad with the directing choices Yeah there a few things here and there that I can nitpick about such as the way they did Nobody Needs to Know, but overall, this isn't something like a Tom Hooper situation where it's just piles and piles of terrible decisions. Generally speaking, the directing is… fine.",
                        "The camera choices are a good fit for what they're going for. The switch between timelines and perspectives is made as clear as you could in film. The musical numbers are done with the energy that you'd want to have. There's no real egregious, oh, you decided to do this scene this way moment.",
                        "But yet the film just doesn't really work. And the reason why it doesn't work feels less because of any particularly bad choices and more just the differences in the medium. Because once again, we go back to that difference in the abstract versus literal. On stage, you can get away with only two actors splitting time on stage in a set that's just a single table and a bookshelf.",
                        "But that wouldn't really work in a film. If you tried that, it would feel too experimental, and too much like you just pointed a camera at a stage show. And the more complicated your set design gets, the weirder and more awkward it's going to feel to have a single actor belt a number in it without anybody else present, especially if the song is theoretically being sung to someone. So because of this, the movie basically disregards the only one actor on stage at a time setup.",
                        "Both of them are on screen together for a large part of the movie, there's a whole bunch of extras in each scene now, and in general, the film is shot and staged much like a conventional movie. This should theoretically make the show work better as a film, but no, not really. It's honestly a lot more awkward, the film didn't really make any real changes to the script or lyrics or any of the songs. Nothing substantial at least, they're all still written as, basically, solos meant to be performed more at air than at living people.",
                        "And because they're now being performed at other characters rather than at air, you get these honestly sort of uncomfortable scenes where a person will be singing to the other actor who has no choice but to just sit there and watch and try to come up with proper facial reactions. They did add some bonus dialogue to help balance it out and make it feel less one-sided, but it still sticks out really, really poorly. The end result is a film that didn't do anything egregiously wrong, but still feels like a significant downgrade over its stage version. Even if you don't mind the strange way the songs play out in the film, losing the uniqueness of the one-person-at-a-time staging does ruin a lot of of the show's impact.",
                        "It changes the way you see the two characters. It changes the way you see the two events unfold. In the play, what you're supposed to be seeing is a biased, one-sided perspective, and the staging reinforced that. But the film being shot more conventionally means that, theoretically, you're seeing an objective, reliable perspective.",
                        "It really breaks a lot of what the play is going for, and what makes it so unique in the first place, and it's not necessarily because of directorial choices, but rather just because the medium is so different that I can't imagine the last five years working on screen at all without it just being essentially a recording of the stage show. And honestly, what we can take away from the last five years' problems being adapted to film can be applied pretty easily to Dear Evan Hansen, because it also struggles with this. The difference being that the issues are less because of the format of the musical, and legit just the direction being overall pretty shit. Dear Evan Hansen is a lot more conventional of a stage show than the last five years.",
                        "It follows the standard beats you'd expect from a stage musical. Opening number, brief scene of dialogue, next musical number, that's an I Want song, scene of dialogue, musical number, dialogue, ensemble number, etc. There's nothing about the way Dear Evan Hansen is structured that makes it significantly different than your average Disney musical when you get down to it. So translating it to film wouldn't necessarily be easy, but it isn't impossible.",
                        "But oh god, talk about making essentially every wrong choice you possibly could. There's been this recent trend of musical movies that are seemingly ashamed to be musical movies, made by directors who don't really understand the genre or how to film it. Tom Hooper's Les Mis wasn't the first film to fall under this category, but it's certainly the most notable. Films in this category are generally made by prestige-slash-award-centric directors who will say that they're trying to approach the musical with a sort of grounded feel which just… no.",
                        "Like even the most downbeat of musicals is larger than life. The basis of the style itself involves people feeling so much emotion that they have to sing about it. Saying you want to make a grounded and realistic musical is like saying you want to make a subdued opera or a good video game music cover band. It's a fundamental misunderstanding of what material you're working with.",
                        "And yes, it is true that Dear Evan Hansen is more grounded than a lot of its stage contemporaries. This isn't a Hadestown or even a Hamilton. There's no elaborate dance sequences or complex musicality. Like I said before, it's basically your standard musical setup of dialogue followed by song followed by dialogue, and the world itself is meant to be as close to our modern day world and the songs are pretty much a standard pop affair with no real big showstoppers.",
                        "But like, even then, there still needs to be some attempt at making the music numbers via staging and blocking not be… bad. Theoretically speaking, the way you would shoot and block and film a musical scene is going to be significantly different than the way you'd just do a normal one. A musical number is a break from the reality of the world, leaving realism behind and prioritizing rhythm. So okay, let's take In the Heights, the movie, as a good recent example of this.",
                        "In the Heights isn't a perfect film. And I do have some issues with it, mainly the deviations from the original stage play and the complete gutting of Nina and Benny's storyline. But god did it feel good to watch a recent musical film that didn't absolutely hate being a musical In the Heights is admittedly a way more over show than Evan Hansen It a musical fans musical It made to have a large ensemble and have grand elaborate dance scenes and a million show-stopping numbers. So obviously the cinematography is going to reflect that in return.",
                        "Songs like 96,000 get this gorgeous pool sequence that feels straight out of classic cinema. Carnival Del Barrio gets long extended moments where the dancers simply get to play around and show off different dance styles from different countries. The opening number has a bunch of citizens in the ensemble out in the street. It can have these larger-than-life moments easier than Evan Hansen can, and it takes full advantage of that.",
                        "But that being said, there are still moments where Heights chills down and creates simpler sequences. No Me Diga is a festive and cheery number led by the closest thing the show has to comic reliefs, but something that stands out when you watch that part of the movie is just how deliberate everything on screen is. The simple act of walking across the salon and sitting on a chair manages to keep the energy of the song going with well-timed cuts that keep up the pace without being obnoxious and well-defined movements from the performers. There's not much here that's too elaborate when you get past the synced up movements of the ensembles and the mannequin heads in the back, but it still manages to feel interesting because the shots are interesting and the performers are making clear, defined, and engaging choices.",
                        "But okay, No Mediga is still a more high energy song than most of the ones in Evan Hansen. I wouldn't necessarily expect, nor would I want things like entire movable sets or weird mannequin heads anywhere in Evan Hansen. With that in mind, let's instead look at Breathe, one of the downbeat songs from In the Heights, and basically the play's first I Want song. Breathe is a slow and melancholy song about Nina, a young woman reflecting on her own anxieties and feelings of failure after struggling through her first year of college and coming back home.",
                        "To convey this on film, Nina is walking through the streets solemnly, seemingly aimlessly, observing those around her and reflecting on her own past life. Once again, we have a number without much that would be super demanding for our lead performer. The other people in the neighborhood do get more elaborate things to do, but even then the dances they do are slower, meant less for show, and more to replicate the type of dancing you might see from older couples dancing and remembering their own joy. It contrasts against Nina's feeling of aimlessness and her sadness.",
                        "The end result is that despite this number being so downbeat and depressing, you're able to understand how Nina feels directionless while still getting something that works as a scene and maintains an energy and structure to it that benefits the music. Now let's compare this to how they shot Dear Evan Hansen's I Want song, waving through a window, because good fucking lord, where to begin? So the song opens the movie and lets you graciously know right away that you're in for a nightmare because this number basically does every sort of film musical sing you could possibly do. You see, the first few minutes are honestly shot… fine.",
                        "Like, it's Evan singing to himself in a room. It's hard to fuck that up. But then the editing goes into overdrive. There's so many cuts here that are super frantic and fast, including one on every time Evan says tap.",
                        "I understand what they're doing here. They're trying to use editing to emulate what his anxiety feels like. But they did way too much. Like, you can't breathe.",
                        "It's like you don't even want to be around watching the movie anymore. I understand what they're going for, but it doesn't work, it's more funny than anything. We also get the next musical movie sin, which is overly literal interpretations of the lyrics. I get why this happens.",
                        "Once again, you have that problem where on stage you're allowed to have the actors just stand around and sing to the audience without worrying much about stage business, or props, or anything complex like that. And so it's easy to go through the lyrics and just match them up to what's going on. And in a lot of respects, it makes sense. Like, if Taylor Swift is singing about dancing in the kitchen around a refrigerator light, then yeah, you show her dancing in the kitchen around the refrigerator light.",
                        "But goddamn sometimes it can be really funny. One example of this was in the Les Mis movie in A Little Fall of Rain. The point of that number is that she's bleeding to death, She thinks it's raining because of the wet blood on her, but they just put a rain machine. Like the first time when Evan sings Waving Through a Window, he's actually looking through a window, and then when he sings Step Out of the Sun, he's actually stepping out of the car and into the sun.",
                        "And it's like, these are metaphors. You realize these are metaphors, right? There was never an actual window. It's like those TikTok videos of people doing literal interpretations of no children except this is done seriously and by a studio that spent millions of dollars on it.",
                        "You are coming down with me, hand in unlovable hands. Once Evan actually gets to the school, you run into the problem with how the extras are directed. Once again, much like the editing, I get what they're trying to do here. You see everyone else in school walking around Evan at their own pace, completely ignoring him and focusing solely on their own lives.",
                        "It's supposed to emphasize Evan's isolation and anxiety when it comes to being around others. But it's also done so fucking poorly because the extras are just wandering around with no real sense of rhythm, purpose, drive, anything. They don't need to be doing a dance number or anything, but right now it feels like they just gave them no direction but walk and then rolled the camera. It just completely zaps the energy out of what should be the climax of the song.",
                        "And it's not helped by the aforementioned weird cutting which takes things either too on beat or weirdly off beat or just does the weird moment where the camera does a 360 arc shot around Evan, but it keeps cutting and restarting where the previous cut started at. Once again, I do get that this is to emulate his anxiety. But it's doing so very poorly. When this is how you start your film out, I don't have any frame of reference as to what the film is going to look like when not in anxiety mode.",
                        "It just looks bad. Also, what the fuck is with this guy not actually hitting his drumset Backtracking a bit there a moment in this number where Evan Evan is in the car as his mom drives him to school This moment is small but incredibly incredibly awkward We have Evan singing his bit of the song while his mom is just there with him existing in the same space but failing to acknowledge what he's doing or participating in it. It just gives him a playful and comforting rub on the shoulder, which weirdly makes it worse than if she didn't acknowledge him at all- at least then it could be seen as Evan existing in his own world, divorced from everyone else. way that it's done makes it super uncomfortable. This is an issue basically all the musical numbers in the film have.",
                        "Once again, we're back in that last 5 years problem. The more grounded and realistic you make your film adaptation, the more additional players you add to a scene, the weirder it's going to be to try and force your characters to interact in it. Dear Evan Hansen doesn't have as many solos as the last 5 years does, but it still manages to look just as awkward as that movie does with basically all of its musical numbers. It certainly doesn't help that the first song we get after Waving Through a Window is For Forever, another Evan solo song which has him passionately lying as he fondly talks about his friendship with Connor to Connor's family.",
                        "Because this is a scene where only Evan sings, it's Ben Platt basically going off on a song where the people around him just have to stare and look and smile, with maybe Amy really needs a new Agent Adams interjecting with dialogue here and there. And this is a five minute song, so you have to live in this space, wanting to crawl under your chair from sheer discomfort for five whole minutes. The stage show is also like this. It's also Evan singing to a mostly silent table at the Murphy House.",
                        "The difference is that the stage show doesn't make me feel like I'm actually in someone's dining room watching a kid sing out of nowhere. The overall direction of the movie is way too grounded, way too serious, way too realistic that whenever a sparse song does happen, it feels like a surprise and actually ruins the flow of the movie and just feels very uncomfortable. Then there's just some weirdly baffling choices. Take the awkward semi-love song If I Could Tell Her, which is about Evan telling Zoe what he likes about her by pretending it was what Connor actually thought of her.",
                        "It's a very strange song since it is written like a love song and it is supposed to be the first song to start their romance plot, but it is also being presented to Zoe as if it's her brother's thoughts about her. I wouldn't know exactly how to stage this either, but I definitely wouldn't do it the way the movie does it. In the stage show, they do it in a relatively simple and basic way. Evan is in Zoe's room, which in this case is basically just a bed and a shelf, and the two get talking, and Evan gets closer and closer to Zoe until he's sitting on her bed, and it ends with him stealing a kiss.",
                        "It's simple, but it gets the job done. You see these two get more intimate as the song goes on, not just emotional but literally closer in space until the final moments, and with this you see a gradual increase in Evan's confidence. But then the movie decides to put this in the Murphy's kitchen, with the majority of the action being Evan and Zoe across from each other as they circle around the island kitchen. And like, this is a very wild disregard for cinematic conventions, because any time you've seen a guy and a girl circle around a kitchen island in film, it's in a scene where he wants to murder her and she's trying to figure out a way out.",
                        "It makes a song that was mildly creepy evolve into something intensely creepy. And it's not helped by it also cutting to these flashbacks that show the old pasty Ben Platt watching Zoey from afar across the years while singing about how much he loves her, which just really, really increases the stalker vibes. Both the distance and the flashbacks ruin the sense of intimacy these two are supposed to have, as they spend most of the song really far away from each other. It cuts to flashback, and then they're both sitting on the couch right next to each other.",
                        "The moments where the two sit beside one another lost and obscured through the edit. It just really, really isn't good. There's also just some minorly buckwild things. Like for some reason having Zoey and Requiem speed up a car and then come to a super abrupt stop, which was just not needed at all.",
                        "Super, super overkill for what's supposed to be an emotional song. That moment in You Will Be Found where they realized they need to explain why Evan's speech was filmed, so they have him mess up and kids laugh at him and take out their phones to record his embarrassment. Which is just… wild to me. Like, imagine if his speech did end up sucking and he wasn't able to turn it around.",
                        "What would they do with that upload? Post it to r slash cringe with the title, teenager drops his cue cards at suicide memorial for his best friend. Thankfully Evan didn't mess up his speech, so they instead uploaded it with the title, His Best Friend Died. You won't believe what he did next, which is the real title that they put in the actual movie for the really sad emotional scene, I shit you not.",
                        "Fucking choices. When this movie isn't making the worst choices possible, it's making the most boring ones. This film has a tendency to really, really go all in on shot-reverse shots, both in its musical numbers and also just in general. There are so many scenes that are just these long, static medium shots of the actors swapping back and forth with no other interesting camera choices or stage movements or anything.",
                        "This can be seen in scenes like the new song The Anonymous Ones, but can especially be felt in the way they shot Only Us. For context, this is the song where Zoe and Evan get together, with Zoe expressing her love for Evan and her desire to progress the relationship beyond bonding over her dead brother. It's the closest thing Dear Evan Hansen has to a romantic song, once you ignore or all the, you know, other stuff that might make it weird. And the movie decides to showcase these two growing closer by mainly showing them separated in their own frames, away from each other and across the room.",
                        "I'm not sure exactly why the film does this so often. If I had to guess, it could be because they just struggled to figure out exactly how to choreograph and frame a lot of these numbers and just defaulting to the most basic option. But another potential possibility is that it is this way because of covid restrictions, because yes, they did film this movie during the height of the pandemic, which means every shot you see on screen is a very good shot is putting someone's life at risk. So that's something, and would explain why they really try to keep everyone six feet apart and in their own frames.",
                        "There are some good moments that I will give credit for. Sincerely me, while still overall not great, especially toward the end with the random fucking go-karts and shit, manages to be the best number in the film by actually doing dancing, starting off with a fun single take shot and just generally feeling more structured and elaborate than the rest of the numbers. It really feels like they put a lot more focus here than they did with the others. There's also some bit of cinematography I like.",
                        "I know I ragged on For Forever, but I do think it's neat how the song basically ends by framing Evan on his own by the window, Connor's parents on their own, and then Zoe getting the frame to herself as they look at Evan. It shows the divide. How the parents are fully buying into Evan while Zoe is reluctant and distant from the others. But what makes me really like it is toward the end, during Words Fail, when we find ourselves back in the dining room with Evan once again toward the window, but this time with Zoe and her parents across from him sharing the frame, showing how united they are in this moment in their disgust toward this fucking kid.",
                        "It's like the one standout time of the cinematography actually doing a good job expressing how the characters feel through framing. As a whole, Dear Evan Hansen's directing is just… not good. It fails to understand how to best elevate the material, how to translate the work to stage, and how to make the most out of the musical numbers. I mean, beyond just looking at individual scenes, the film itself has an overall problem with its tone and direction that bring it down hard.",
                        "Part of the problem with doing the thing where you get these award-aspiring directors to make a film aimed primarily to garner critical acclaim and award recognition, and in my opinion Dear Evan Hansen is 100% an award bait movie, is that they're going to do what they can to emphasize the aspects of the project they feel will get it nominated for an award. As said before, this usually means trying their best to ground it to a sense of realism, one that's not necessarily gritty, but is raw. And not only does Dear Evan Hansen do this, but it also comes with the extra benefit of just sapping basically every ounce of comedy out of the scene and really playing up the emotions of everyone at all times. Basically every scene, every performance is shot and performed like they want you to cry.",
                        "That you're supposed to be moved by how profound it is. I was honestly shocked that they didn't just slap a for your consideration banner on the entire movie. The weird thing about this is that the stage show is a dark comedy. Like, it doesn't go all in on the dark comedy angle the same way similar works like, say, World's Greatest Dad do, but it was still funny when it needed to be. made sure to have a punchline, to have comedic beats, to have moments that broke up the tension.",
                        "I mean, the reason why Sincerely Me is basically the fan favourite number is because it goes all in on the dark comedy aspect in a way the rest of the songs don't. And despite the movie maintaining this song, it basically drops every other instance of humour. It's like the filmmakers saw the way certain parts of the fandom viewed Dear Evan Hansen as this sincere, heartfelt, tearjerker play about mental health, and decided to go all in on it. I mean, look at the way the marketing focused so heavily on You Will Be Found, the song that's supposed to be a double entendre about how Evan is going to inevitably be revealed as a liar, he'll be found, and used it completely sincerely as a song about mental health.",
                        "And every single interview and piece of promotional material is about the emotional impact of the story and how important and meaningful it all is, and it's so not the right way to go about this. I'm not just saying this because I think that movies should have more quips or something, I'm not Joss Whedon, I'm fine with a serious, introspective film that tries to do something emotional. And I can understand why, from their perspective, they might have thought that removing the comedy would show more respect for the subject matter and come off as less tasteless. but weirdly enough, it comes off as more so? When you have those darkly comedic elements, you're allowed to get away with things you probably wouldn't have otherwise.",
                        "Dear Evan Hansen is a show with a deeply intense subject matter and a very complicated main character. The presence of jokes and humor in the stage show act as a sort of acknowledgement of that fact. It's the show giving a wink toward the audience, letting us know that it understands the absurdity and potential tastelessness of what the characters are doing. And more importantly, it makes Evan more charming and relatable and human.",
                        "By showing him engaging in conversations with others, allowing himself to be funny and tell jokes and have moments that are played for soft laughs, we can gain more sympathy for him throughout the show and see him more as a flawed human being. In the movie though, where everything is played so dry and seriously, you have no choice but to examine the implications of everything going on. Without Evan's awkward banter with Zoe played for laughs, the film forces you to think about how creepy their relationship actually is. With the school's sad reaction to Connor's death played almost completely seriously, you have no choice but to think about how little the play is actually about him and how fucked up it is to use a teenager's suicide purely as a plot device without actually fundamentally exploring the implication.",
                        "And without the charm Ben Platt could give Evan on stage, your mind is eventually going to drift off into examining how the film actually does explore his mental health issues and mental health in general and whether or not it actually covers the subject well I think this is a big reason why critical reaction to the movie has been significantly worse than that of the musical Beyond Ben Platt age beyond the musical numbers not being very good or well-directed, the drastic tonal shift honestly makes the material so much worse. By trying to make the work deeper, they essentially forced critics to dig into it more, which meant the work being basically exposed and torn apart in ways it really hadn't before. Or at least that's how it felt to me, because god the movie feels so much worse. So so much worse.",
                        "Musical movies are very hard to do. Sometimes they can elevate the original work, like how Chicago managed to become more interesting than its stage counterpart by changing the musical numbers into these explicit dream sequences representing what's going on in the real world. And as fun as ways to get a musical number to make sense on film go, Saying it takes place on a fictional stage in a cabaret representing someone's psyche is as good of a method as any. God, I love how they do the scene where that one lady gets hanged.",
                        "It's so fucking good. And sometimes musical films can be done just as well as their stage counterparts. Films like Little Shop of Horrors, Cabaret, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and even Hairspray manage to translate what worked on the theatrical show to screen and are overall enjoyable experiences in their own right. And sometimes you have Cats, which exists in a tier all on its own, away from any sort of judgement beyond our moral comprehension.",
                        "And then you have the bad ones, the ones that really miss the mark. You're Les Mis, you're Phantom, you're Into the Woods, which aren't just bad films, but actively seem to misunderstand and work against the appeal of the original version. Dear Evan Hansen falls into that category, as do a lot of musical films, unfortunately. And the thing that sucks is that for a lot of shows, film adaptations like these are the only way that most people can experience them.",
                        "Meaning that a lot of the times, if you want to experience a show you like in ways other than just listening to the cast recording, you're left with little option but to watch a subpar screen adaptation. But what if there were other options. So for the longest time, it seemed like there was a clear path for the life of a musical. It runs on stage, and then if the producers decide that it's run for enough time that ticket sales won't be affected by a non-theatre version, they begin optioning off the project for potential adaptations, meaning that those at home can finally experience Phantom of the Opera almost 20 years after it debuted on Broadway.",
                        "And if the Phantom movie sucks, well, Sorry. Guess we'll just have to go grab tickets to a live performance. However, this has changed a bit recently. I did a whole other video on this.",
                        "But this increased demand for musicals and the nature of the internet has created an entire platform for the distribution of musical bootlegs, illegal recordings of shows that are later posted online. This dramatically changes the way in which we look at these film adaptations. Before the internet, musical bootlegs weren't necessarily impossible, but they were a lot harder to just stumble across. But now, if you want to find a bootleg of a show, you can just google that show and chances are you can find it pretty easily.",
                        "Not that I would condone such a thing, but I'm just saying that trying to say you need a film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen to immortalize Ben Platt's performance rings a bit hollow in a world where I can google blue slime tutorial and find a video of the original Broadway cast. Bootlegs especially rose to greater prominence in 2020, as with the global worldwide panini shutting down theatres, they became the only way for people to consume shows during that time. And I don't have anything to prove this, but I personally think that this also affected the way theatre companies viewed bootlegs. Beforehand, years ago, bootlegs and slime tutorials would get taken down super quickly and super easily.",
                        "Someone would upload that one DVD-fab bootleg of Hamilton, if you know the one, you know the one, and you only had a few hours to watch it before it was taken down. Same with Hadestown and Dear Evan Hansen and other big productions. But now there's just a plethora of bootlegs on YouTube, with hundreds of thousands of views that have been up for months, if not years. It definitely seems like the powers that be have gotten so much more relaxed about this sort of thing, which is nice because it opens a lot more opportunities for people to experience a lot more shows.",
                        "Bootlegs aren't perfect. They generally have poor visual quality, sometimes the camera won't focus on the things you want focused on, and sometimes you just can't see or hear what's going on well at all. But they can still be entertaining to watch, and in a lot of respects are still better than a lot of the film counterparts. Like, I can honestly say that I preferred watching the camcorder bootleg of Dear Evan Hansen over the $30 million film adaptation.",
                        "But if the visuals, or questionable legality of bootlegs bothers you, that's fine and understandable. Watching a stage version of a show can be nice, but you might not like tracking down a version on an illicit source that's filmed on someone's potato. Well, that's where you get to one of the other, more interesting recent developments- pro recordings. Professional recordings of stage shows aren't anything new- they've technically been around for a while.",
                        "But they were generally pretty rare. Much like film adaptations, a lot of theatre companies don't want to have an outside version of the show that could potentially disincentivise someone from actually seeing it live. As such, pro recordings were generally only released for shows that had been going on for a while or that weren't going to be open for much longer. It took around 20 or so years for popular stage shows like Cats and Rent and Phantom of the Opera to finally get professional recordings.",
                        "Although, pretty much every show has has a proper camera recording of it, New York Public Library has access to it, it's just that most of us are not allowed to go in there and watch those things. Fun fact. That being said, pro recordings have their own unique problem. Part of the reason why you still saw film adaptations more than pro recordings is because for a while, there wasn't really a good way to distribute pro recordings at least not in a way that would maximize profits Recordings of live shows and concerts don usually get theatrical runs which meant for a while the only method for releasing pro recordings was direct and direct Which is fine But well direct video stuff used to come with this stigma of being of lesser quality than theatrical counterparts.",
                        "And it would almost certainly mean not making as much money. There was some hope that this could change though. Back in 2016, renowned lip-biter Lin-Manuel Miranda made sure to get a full HD professional recording of Hamilton done with the original Broadway cast. The goal was to keep the recording in storage for a little while before debuting it to the public.",
                        "And sure enough, the mouse himself Disney bought the rights to it for $75 million with plans to give it a full theatrical release on October 15th, 2021. And then, like, the world shut down. And so instead, it was retooled into a Disney Plus exclusive, and its release pushed way, way up to July 3rd, 2020. And it was a huge, huge success.",
                        "Now, there's a lot of discourse about Hamilton, discourse that is banned from this channel because I do not want to get into it, but I'll say this, the Hamilton Pro recording does a very, very good job replicating the energy of the stage show. Whatever you like about the stage show is basically still here, and if you like Hamilton, you'll like the pro recording, and if you've never experienced Hamilton, then you'll get a quality initial experience with this. And most importantly, this thing was fucking massive. Streaming companies don't generally release viewer numbers, but going by estimates, Hamilton was viewed by around 22 million people in its first month of release, which is a stupidly high number.",
                        "It was the second most watched straight to streaming title that year, right behind Wonder Woman 1984. This is really interesting because it showed that, under the right circumstances, audiences are 100% willing to watch a recorded version of a stage show rather than a full film adaptation. Furthermore, it also showed that streaming platforms are a good place to distribute these sort of things. Much like the way it's easy to stumble across and watch a musical on YouTube without much personal investment, people can stumble upon shows they're curious about on a subscription streaming platform and watch them.",
                        "And the demand for such things is there and huge. It's difficult to say how Hamilton's streaming version success will affect other productions going forward. Not all shows were lucky enough to have filmed a performance years before the lockdown, so there weren't a lot of immediate copycats trying to imitate its success. We have seen one, though.",
                        "Before the pandemic, there were plans to adapt Come From Away into a feature film, which is just… not a great idea if you've seen that show. Like, a large part of its appeal is experimenting with the theatre format and its ensemble and the pacing and intensity of a live show. Once the pandemic happened though, these plans basically evaporated as it was impossible to make any progress on the film version and interest in the project dropped. However, upon seeing the success of Hamilton on Disney+, it was decided that instead of a film adaptation, they would instead change course and create a pro recording exclusively for Apple TV.",
                        "And while I don't know how successful it was, because obviously Come From Away is nowhere near as popular as Hamilton, I can say that the pro recording is pretty good and definitely worth a watch, and I'm pretty confident in saying that it's better than any film adaptation of the material would have been. It'll be interesting to see if more shows start doing this. There's a whole debate to be had about streaming exclusive content, and I know it can be annoying, but I would rather have Hulu get exclusive rights to a Hadestown Pro recording than have to sit through a Universal Pictures film version. I think for a lot of shows, this method is a lot better and leads to a better quality product.",
                        "And with Broadway's already existing issues with accessibility, I think this is a very good middle ground, and I would love to see more Pro recordings get released in the future. Dear Evan Hansen is bad. I don't think anyone here is going to debate me on that, especially after watching two hours of me ramble about it. It's a dull, depressing, plodding mess of a movie that's uninteresting at best, potentially tasteless at worst.",
                        "But as I sat there and watched it and made fun of it with my co-writer Emily, I realized that Dear Evan Hansen itself isn't the problem. Rather, it's a symptom of a much worse disease. Musical movies are a strange art form, and one that's been in an awkward zone recently. After their resurgence to prominence in the early 2000s with Chicago and Moulin Rouge, it's been an up and down battle between films that understand the assignment and films that don't.",
                        "And it's really interesting to me that a time where we're getting really good musical films like In the Heights and Annette also gave us such films as Amazon Prime's Cinderella and Dear Evan Hansen. And considering how we're about to get things like West Side Story and The Wicked Movie for real this time, it's tempting to look at exactly why certain musical adaptations do and don't work so you know whether or not to get your hopes up about the Wicked Movie that's happening certainly for real this time, guys. I went into this video with the simple mission statement of trashing Dear Evan Hansen because it's a bad and easily mockable movie, but the more I dug through it and the more I thought about it, the more I realized that my frustrations with Dear Evan Hansen as a film don't come from a place of hate, but out of love. I love musicals.",
                        "I love them a lot. I think that they can be fun and incredibly compelling works of art that can entertain and enlighten. It's the combination of the art of music and the art of dance and the art of cinema into a beautiful amalgamation. And that's why it's so disappointing when that combination comes out looking more like a clusterfucked homunculus.",
                        "During the writing process, after this script had already been mostly written, I learned the news that Stephen Sondheim had died. I don't know if you can tell, just from the absolute nerding out that happened in this video, but Into the Woods is my absolute favorite musical of all time. The characters, the musicality, the writing, the themes, everything about it resonates with me so hard. And so many people have that feeling with so many of Sondheim's works, all of which I honestly love.",
                        "So much of what he's written has resonated with so many people and it all an absolutely incredible testament not only to what this man has created throughout his life but also what he created specifically within the medium of theatre His work is some Broadway Broadway and it all such an incredible way of showcasing what you can do with musicals that you can't always do as effectively with other mediums. When I saw Sweeney Todd in like an off-Broadway stage they set up to be a pie shop, the characters walking and living and dying all around you and in the same space as you, I felt so pulled in and immersed in a way I've never quite experienced in another medium. When you listen to a song like Not Getting Married Today and you hear everyone sing at the same time, the different vocal styles and tempos and lyrics reflecting how their very discordant mental states come together, you feel so pulled in not just by theatre but by the fact that it's theatre. This was never intended to be a Sondheim video, but honestly, so much of what Sondheim has put into the world of theatre is both a testament and a blessing to the very nature of the medium.",
                        "It's hard to say what path movie musicals will take from this point on. The box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and unfortunately In the Heights, mixed with the absurd success of Hamilton's pro recording could lead to a drastic shift in how these projects get made, and if we even get theatrical film adaptations at all. In a lot of respects right now, a lot of hope is resting on West Side Story and Wicked to hopefully pick up that slack and prove that there's still an audience out there for the musical movie. It's a format that has promise, and as we've seen throughout some of the examples in the video, can be done well, on rare occasions even in ways that are better or more interesting than their stage counterparts.",
                        "But these films are so often made without a true understanding of what a musical is and what it should be, and what parts of it can be altered to still create an interesting piece of art. One of the things we see a lot with projects like the Dear Evan Hansen movie is a rejection of what makes musicals musicals. Of strong choreography, of emotionally explosive musical numbers, of line delivery that's alive and a little bit exaggerated. And as someone who loves the things that make up what a musical is, that's a little sad to see.",
                        "And that's why honestly, if the rise of professionally shot stage musicals does indeed end up overshadowing the current trend of film adaptations, I'm gonna be pretty okay with that. In all fairness though, the real reason for that has nothing to do with anything I've said over the past like two hours. The real reason is that in this hypothetical future, we may never again have to see a movie musical that has James Corden in it. In case you couldn't tell, one of my favorite things is looking at random pieces of media and trying to work out what sort of storytelling lessons we might be able to take away from them, even ones we didn't necessarily expect.",
                        "In this video, I didn't just want to talk about Dear Evan Hansen so much as use it as a case study for the medium of musicals in general. And if you enjoyed me doing that, you might enjoy Debater Theatre, a special video I've made that is exclusive to Nebula. Nebula is essentially a collaborative streaming platform by me and a bunch of other creators you might know and like. People like Big Joel, or Lindsay Ellis, or FD Signifier, or Terrible Writing Advice, or even just recently, my co-writer Emily.",
                        "For one, it lets us make videos that might not be best suited for YouTube. Like I was very worried making this one because it touches on themes of mental health, which automatically makes me worry about stuff like monetization. With Nebula, you're able to see a lot of content that wouldn't necessarily make its way onto YouTube. So not only are you able to watch all our videos early and without ads or sponsored segments on Nebula, but you also get access to Nebula Originals- exclusive videos that you can only find on that platform.",
                        "So for example for me, Debater Theatre is a video I made where I talk about learning to become a more persuasive person, and I do it by showing you that debate and persuasive rhetoric exists all around us, from movies to commercials to even award acceptance speeches. But you can also find tons of other Nebula originals on the platform by creators you hopefully love. Nebula has also partnered with CuriosityStream, a really cool streaming service that has thousands of absolutely fascinating documentaries about things like science, history, nature, and technology. And it's incredibly cool.",
                        "If you're interested in theatre like me, there's this great TV program on there called Can a Computer Write a Hit Musical that's all about what artificial intelligence means and how it relates to human creativity. It also has a lot of obvious love for musicals and how it can resonate with people baked into it, which I honestly think is just really amazing.

                        "The speaker discusses the musical Dear Evan Hansen and its recent film adaptation. They analyze what went wrong with the movie and how it failed to translate the stage show to the screen. The speaker also touches on the trend of musical adaptations and the challenges of bringing Broadway shows to the big screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has several issues, including poor casting choices, particularly with Ben Platt playing Evan Hansen at an age that doesn't align with the character's high school age.",
                        "The film also struggles with translating the stage production to screen, making it hard to empathize with Evan's character. The music in the film is also criticized, with added songs feeling shoehorned and generic. The adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen for film has several issues, primarily with the cutting of certain songs and changes to the script. The speaker argues that these changes, such as cutting the song 'Does Anybody Have a Map?'",
                        "and replacing 'Good For You' with a two-minute argument scene, detract from the story and characters. The film's attempts to address criticisms of the stage show, like making Evan admit to lying on social media, fall flat. The speaker also criticizes the film's direction and cinematography, saying they don't effectively translate the stage show to screen. The speaker discusses the difficulties of adapting stage musicals to film, using Dear Evan Hansen and The Last Five Years as examples.",
                        "They highlight the differences between the two mediums, particularly in terms of how time and space are conveyed, and how musical numbers are staged and shot. The speaker argues that the film adaptations of these musicals often struggle to translate the unique qualities of the stage productions to the screen. The film adaptation of Dear Evan Hansen has been criticized for its awkward and uncomfortable musical numbers, poor directing, and drastic tonal shift from the stage show. The movie's attempts to ground the story in realism come across as forced and unnatural, leading to a dull and depressing viewing experience.",
                        "The speaker argues that the film's problems are not unique to Dear Evan Hansen, but rather a symptom of a larger issue with musical film adaptations. The speaker discusses their love for musicals, specifically highlighting Stephen Sondheim's works, and analyzes the current state of movie musicals, citing the box office failures of Cats, Dear Evan Hansen, and In the Heights. They express concern that film adaptations often lack the essence of what makes musicals great, such as strong choreography and emotionally explosive numbers. The speaker also promotes their content on Nebula and CuriosityStream."
