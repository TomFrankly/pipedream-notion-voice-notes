While he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard, Minerva came down from heaven, for Juno had sent her in the love she bore to them both, and seized the son of Pelias by his yellow hair, visible to him alone, for of the others no man could see her.

Mother, he cried, you bore me doomed to live but for a little season.\n\nSurely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that little glorious. Is it not so? Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour, and has robbed me of my prize by force.

I see, moreover, many other Achaeans whose names I could tell you, but there are two whom I can nowhere find.\n\nCastor, breaker of horses, and Pollux, the mighty boxer. They are children of my mother, and own brothers to myself. Either they have not left Lacedaemon, or else, though they have brought their ships, they will not show themselves in battle for the shame and disgrace that I have brought upon them. She knew not that both of these heroes were already lying under the earth in their own land of Lacedaemon.\n\n",

She guided it to the part where the golden buckles of the belt that passed over his double cuirass were fastened, so the arrow struck the belt that went tightly round him.\n\nIt went right through this and through the cuirass of cunning workmanship. It also pierced the belt beneath it which he wore next his skin to keep out darts or arrows. It was this that served him in the best stead.

Now the son of Tydeus was in pursuit of the Cyprian goddess spear in hand for he knew her to be feeble and not one of those goddesses that can lord it among men in battle like Minerva or Enyo the waster of cities And when at last after a long chase he caught her up he flew at her and thrust his spear into the flesh of her delicate hand The point tore through the ambrosial robe which the graces had woven for her, and pierced the skin between her wrist and the palm of her hand, so that the immortal blood, or hycor, that flows in the veins of the blessed gods, came pouring from the wound, for the gods do not eat bread nor drink wine, hence they have no blood such as ours, and are immortal. Venus screamed aloud and let her son fall But Phoebus Apollo caught him in his arms And hid him in a cloud of darkness Lest some Danaean should drive a spear into his breast and kill him And Diomed shouted out\n\n",

Fierce Mars, to help the Trojans, covered them in a veil of darkness, and went about everywhere among them, inasmuch as Phoebus Apollo had told him, that when he saw Pallas Minerva leave the fray, he was to put courage into the hearts of the Trojans, for it was she who was helping the Danaans. Then Apollo sent Aeneas forth from his rich sanctuary, and filled his heart with valour, whereon he took his place among his comrades, who were overjoyed at seeing him alive, sound, and of a good courage, but they could not ask him how it had all happened, for they were too busy with the turmoil raised by Mars and by strife, who raged insatiably in their midst.

But with that high spirit which was ever present with him, he challenged the youth of the Cadmeans, and at once beat them in all that he attempted, so mightily did I help him. I stand by you too to protect you, and I bid you be instant in fighting the Trojans, but either you are tired out, or you are afraid and out of heart, and in that case I say that you are no true son of Tidius, the son of Aeneas.\n\nDiomed answered, I know you, goddess, daughter of ages-bearing Jove, and will hide nothing from you. I am not afraid, nor out of heart, nor is there any slackness in me. I am only following your own instructions. You told me not to fight any of the blessed gods, but if Jove's daughter Venus came into battle, I was to wound her with my spear.\n\n",

Mars, insatiate of battle, killed his son Isander while he was fighting the Selimi.\n\n",

This, then, is the descent I claim. Thus did he speak, and the heart of Diomed was glad.\n\nHe planted his spear in the ground and spoke to him with friendly words. Then he said, You are an old friend of my father's house. Great Aeneas once entertained Bellerophon for twenty days, and the two exchanged presents. Aeneas gave a rich belt with purple, and Bellerophon a double cup, which I left at home when I set out for Troy.\n\n",

Do not think of fighting a man so much stronger than yourself as Hector, son of Priam, who is feared by many another as well as you.

Priam had forbidden the Trojans to wail aloud, so they heaped their dead sadly and silently upon the pyre, and having burned them, went back to the city of Elios.\n\n",

Read by Peter Dan Book 9 The Embassy to Achilles Thus did the Trojans watch, but panic, comrade of blood-stained rout, had taken fast hold of the Achaeans, and their princes were all of them in despair. As when the two winds that blow from Thrace, the north and the north-west, spring up of a sudden and rouse the fury of the main, in a moment the dark waves up rear their heads and scatter their sea-rack in all directions, even thus troubled were the hearts of the Achaeans. The son of Atreus, in dismay, bade the heralds call the people to a council, man by man, but not to cry the matter aloud.\n\n",

And King Agamemnon answered.\n\nMenelaus, we both of us need shrewd counsel to save the Argives and our ships, for Jove has changed his mind, and inclines towards Hector's sacrifices rather than ours. I never saw nor heard tell of any man as having wrought such ruin in one day as Hector has now wrought against the sons of the Achaeans, and that too of his own unaided self, for he is son neither to God nor God The Argives will rue it long and deeply. Run, therefore, with all speed by the line of the ships, and call Ajax and Idomeneas. Meanwhile I will go to Nestor, and bid him rise, and go about among the companies of our sentinels to give them their instructions.\n\n",

Diomed knew that it was the goddess, and at once sprang upon the horses. Ulysses beat them with his bow, and they fled onward to the ships of the Achaeans.\n\nBut Apollo kept no blind lookout when he saw Minerva with the son of Tidius. He was angry with her, and coming to the host of the Trojans, he roused Hippocoon, a counsellor of the Thracians and a noble kinsman of Rhesus. He started up out of his sleep, and saw that the horses were no longer in their place, and that the men were gasping in their death agony.

Eurypylus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh, and I have just been bringing this man from the field. He too wounded with an arrow. Nevertheless Achilles, so valiant though he be Cares not, and knows no ruth Will he wait till the ships do what we may Are in a blaze, and we perish one upon the other?\n\n",

Even so did famed Idomeneas hold his ground and budge not at the coming of Aeneas.\n\nHe cried aloud to his comrades, looking towards Ascalaphus, Apharius, Deeperis, Meriones and Antilochus, all of them brave soldiers. Hither, my friends, he cried, and leave me not single-handed. I go in great fear by fleet Aeneas, who is coming against me, and is a redoubtable dispenser of death in battle. Moreover he is in the flower of youth when a man's strength is greatest.\n\n",

Nevertheless he was glad and made sure of victory.\n\nForthwith, however, the son of Atreus drew his sword and sprang upon him. Pesander then seized the bronze battle-axe with its long and polished handle of olive wood that hung by his side under his shield, and the two made it one another. Pesander struck the peak of Menelaus's crested helmet just under the crest itself, and Menelaus hit Pesander as he was coming towards him, on the forehead, just at the rise of his nose. The bones cracked, and his two gore-bedrabbled eyes fell by his feet in the dust.\n\n",

I should hold a loof from battle on any day rather than this For my mother bore me with nothing of the coward about me from the moment when you set our men fighting about the ships we have been staying here and doing battle with the Danaans our comrades about whom you ask me are dead Diaphobus and King Helanus alone have left the field wounded both of them in the hand but the son of Saturn saved them alive Now, therefore, lead on where you would have us go, and we will follow with right good will. You shall not find us fail you insofar as our strength holds out, but no man can do more than in him lies, no matter how willing he may be.\n\n",

He kept stepping forward under cover of his shield in every direction, making trial of the ranks to see if they would give way before him, but he could not daunt the courage of the Achaeans.\n\nAjax was the first to stride out and challenge him. Sir, he cried, draw near. Why do you think thus vainly to dismay the Argives? We Achaeans are excellent soldiers, but the scourge of Jove has fallen heavily upon us.\n\n",
