                "text": " Welcome to the Notion Formula Bootcamp. We are going to kick things immediately into high gear and create two useful Notion formulas in this lesson. And every lesson in this course has both a written version and a video version. So you can pick whichever you like. This audio narration is provided to pace you through the written version in case that's helpful to you, but you don't have to use it. Now, you're going to find a more traditional course intro in the next section, but I wanted to start things out here with giving you a quick win. Now, quick wins are crucial to long-term successful learning, in my opinion. By getting your hands really dirty and experiencing quick wins, you'll gain motivation and confidence to keep pushing you deeper into the learning curve. So, let's get started. Here's a page from my Notion Pokedex, and this entry is for Articuno, which happens to be my favorite Pokemon. And it's mostly complete. But there's just one problem. What's up with these height and weight values? A height of 17? A weight of 554? pretty sure a bird does not weigh that much. So what's going on here? Well, these height and weight values are pulled from PokeAPI, a resource that has data on every Pokemon in existence. And the data in PokeAPI is exactly the same as the data in the official Pokemon games. And for technical reasons, the Pokemon developers decided to store height values in decimeters and weight values in hectograms. And if you're US-based like me and you don't readily know what these terms mean, they're lesser known units in the metric system. Desi means a tenth, while hecto means 100. So a decimeter is one-tenth of a meter and a hectogram is 100 grams or one-tenth of a kilogram. So to make these values more readable, let's create two notion formulas, one to convert decimeters to meters and one to convert hectograms into kilograms. Let's go ahead and build the first one. Height, decimeters to meters. Now I've created a template version of my Pokedex that you can access and duplicate into your own workspace. Click that link, duplicate the template into your workspace, and then navigate to the Articuno page Next create a new property with the formula property type and call it height parentheses M parentheses If you need a refresher on creating database properties by the way you can find one in my Notion database guide In the formula editor enter the following formula and here's the formula in vocal form. Format parentheses, prompt parentheses, height parentheses, divided by 10 parentheses plus M. Like magic, you're going to see this formula return Articuno's height in meters, 1.7 meters. Congrats, you've just written your first Notion formula. Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at that really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation for Charmander as well. This is the beauty of the way that formulas and database properties interact. Across your database, the height M property is written the same. However, because your formula pulls information from other properties, in this case, height, the return value can be different for each database row. By the way, you've also just used six Notion formula principles, all in a single one-line formula. The format function, type conversion, a property reference, the division operator, a hard-coded number, and string concatenation. Now, don't worry if you don't know what any of these terms mean just yet. I'm going to explain them all in a minute. And by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them. For now, let's put your brain to work. I gave you the formula for height in meters. Now it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms. Challenge, create a weight kilograms formula. Using what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms. If you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno. Now challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch. I will give you two small hints to get started. First, the formula will be extremely similar to the one we just built for height and meters. And second, think about the unit conversion that we're trying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress I would urge you not to look at that answer until you've at least followed the 15-minute rule, which I have linked in this lesson. The best piece of advice I can give you for both completing this course and learning anything is to embrace the learning curve. View yourself as the kind of person who runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall when it confronts you. Breaking down the formula. As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas. These principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas. And fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road. They certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly. Now let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly. For each, I'm going to link to the relevant section in my Notion formula reference in case you want to dig deeper. And you're going to see me link to this formula reference a lot throughout this course. This is akin to the way that any JavaScript course worth its salt would at least tell you to go look at the MDN web docs. They are the definitive reference for the language. And these links are present for thoroughness as I am a detail-oriented nerd. But if you are intimidated by them, feel free to skip them for now. We are going to cover everything important throughout this course, and we're going to do it in an action-oriented manner. Now, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing. First, this formula is going to get the value of the height property. Now, height is a number type property. In Articuno's case, the value is 17. It then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7. And I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database. By contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is. The format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of this entire formula is 1.7m, or meters. Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned above come into play here. First, the format function. This is a function that accepts data of any type as its argument and converts that data to a string. Type Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers, dates, and boolean values . However, they can only return data of a single type. Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas. Property Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the value of any other property in the same database. Division Operator This just divides a number by another number. You can also use the divide function, but the slash character is just so much more convenient. Hard-coded number. Hard-coded is my term for data that you write directly into a formula. The opposite of hard-coded data would be a property reference. String concatenation. This basically means combining two strings together. For example, monkey D as one string and Luffy as another string would return monkey D Luffy if you concatenated them together. Now you can also use the concat function for this, but again, the plus operator is just so much more easy to use and it's much more flexible as well. All right, let's move on. Don't worry if some of what we covered here feels confusing. The entire point of this lesson is to number one, give you a quick win in order to motivate you to push forward, but number two, give you some early exposure to several concepts that will be important later on. Remember those video games that give your character like all their abilities and weapons and gear in the first level, only to then take it all away before you go into So the next one, this is a classic trick in game design. It gives you a taste of what's to come, and it also makes each new ability and upgrade feel somewhat familiar when you finally unlock it later in the game. And that small amount of familiarity can help you to build mastery much faster. So now that we've finished this initial challenge, let's move on to the proper course introduction.",

So what's going on here? Well, these height and\n\n20\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.860\nweight values are pulled from PokeAPI, a resource that has data on every Pokemon in existence.\n\n21\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.460\nAnd the data in PokeAPI is exactly the same as the data in the official Pokemon games.\n\n22\n00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.140\nAnd for technical reasons, the Pokemon developers decided to store height values in decimeters\n\n23\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.280\nand weight values in hectograms. And if you're US-based like me and you don't readily know what\n\n24\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.900\nthese terms mean, they're lesser known units in the metric system. Desi means a tenth,\n\n25\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.900\nwhile hecto means 100. So a decimeter is one-tenth of a meter and a hectogram is 100 grams or one-tenth\n\n26\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.500\nof a kilogram. So to make these values more readable, let's create two notion formulas,\n\n27\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.700\none to convert decimeters to meters and one to convert hectograms into kilograms. Let's go ahead\n\n28\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.800\nand build the first one. Height, decimeters to meters. Now I've created a template version of\n\n29\n00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.840\nmy Pokedex that you can access and duplicate into your own workspace. Click that link,\n\n30\n00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.720\nduplicate the template into your workspace,\n\n31\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:10.786\nand then navigate to the Articuno page Next create a new property with the formula property type and call it height parentheses M parentheses If you need a refresher on creating database properties by the way you can find one in my Notion database guide In the formula editor enter the following formula\n\n32\n00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:16.426\nand here's the formula in vocal form. Format parentheses, prompt parentheses, height\n\n33\n00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:23.026\nparentheses, divided by 10 parentheses plus M. Like magic, you're going to see this formula\n\n34\n00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:29.006\nreturn Articuno's height in meters, 1.7 meters. Congrats, you've just written your first Notion\n\n35\n00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:33.986\nformula. Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at\n\n36\n00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:37.426\nthat really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation\n\n37\n00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:43.446\nfor Charmander as well. This is the beauty of the way that formulas and database properties interact.\n\n38\n00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:49.086\nAcross your database, the height M property is written the same. However, because your formula\n\n39\n00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:55.046\npulls information from other properties, in this case, height, the return value can be different\n\n40\n00:02:55.046 --> 00:03:00.246\nfor each database row. By the way, you've also just used six Notion formula principles,\n\n41\n00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:06.946\nall in a single one-line formula. The format function, type conversion, a property reference,\n\n42\n00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:13.666\nthe division operator, a hard-coded number, and string concatenation. Now, don't worry if you\n\n43\n00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:17.366\ndon't know what any of these terms mean just yet. I'm going to explain them all in a minute.\n\n44\n00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:21.186\nAnd by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them.\n\n45\n00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.606\nFor now, let's put your brain to work.\n\n46\n00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:26.086\nI gave you the formula for height in meters.\n\n47\n00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.866\nNow it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms.\n\n48\n00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:33.765\nChallenge, create a weight kilograms formula.\n\n49\n00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:37.265\nUsing what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms.\n\n50\n00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:42.386\nIf you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno.\n\n51\n00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.646\nNow challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch.\n\n52\n00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:51.086\nI will give you two small hints to get started. First, the formula will be extremely similar to\n\n53\n00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:56.126\nthe one we just built for height and meters. And second, think about the unit conversion that we're\n\n54\n00:03:56.126 --> 00:04:10.532\ntrying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress\n\n55\n00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:12.312\nI would urge you not to look at that answer\n\n56\n00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:15.192\nuntil you've at least followed the 15-minute rule,\n\n57\n00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.091\nwhich I have linked in this lesson.\n\n58\n00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:19.052\nThe best piece of advice I can give you\n\n59\n00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:21.612\nfor both completing this course and learning anything\n\n60\n00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:23.772\nis to embrace the learning curve.\n\n61\n00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.012\nView yourself as the kind of person\n\n62\n00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:28.972\nwho runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall\n\n63\n00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:29.972\nwhen it confronts you.\n\n64\n00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:36.672\nBreaking down the formula. As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas.\n\n65\n00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:42.212\nThese principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas.\n\n66\n00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:47.732\nAnd fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road.\n\n67\n00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.112\nThey certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly.\n\n68\n00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:55.872\nNow let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly.\n\n69\n00:04:55.872 --> 00:05:00.812\nFor each, I'm going to link to the relevant section in my Notion formula reference in case you want to dig deeper.\n\n70\n00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.272\nAnd you're going to see me link to this formula reference a lot throughout this course.\n\n71\n00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:11.132\nThis is akin to the way that any JavaScript course worth its salt would at least tell you to go look at the MDN web docs.\n\n72\n00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.752\nThey are the definitive reference for the language.\n\n73\n00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:17.892\nAnd these links are present for thoroughness as I am a detail-oriented nerd.\n\n74\n00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:21.692\nBut if you are intimidated by them, feel free to skip them for now.\n\n75\n00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:26.592\nWe are going to cover everything important throughout this course, and we're going to do it in an action-oriented manner.\n\n76\n00:05:27.212 --> 00:05:31.072\nNow, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing.\n\n77\n00:05:31.492 --> 00:05:34.692\nFirst, this formula is going to get the value of the height property.\n\n78\n00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:38.752\nNow, height is a number type property. In Articuno's case, the value is 17.\n\n79\n00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:43.992\nIt then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7.\n\n80\n00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:50.992\nAnd I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database.\n\n81\n00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:56.832\nBy contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is.\n\n82\n00:05:57.132 --> 00:06:15.198\nThe format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of\n\n83\n00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:21.598\nthis entire formula is 1.7m, or meters. Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned\n\n84\n00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:26.598\nabove come into play here. First, the format function. This is a function that accepts data\n\n85\n00:06:26.598 --> 00:06:31.158\nof any type as its argument and converts that data to a string.\n\n86\n00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:34.578\nType Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers,\n\n87\n00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:40.478\ndates, and boolean values . However, they can only return data of a single\n\n88\n00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:45.438\ntype. Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas.\n\n89\n00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.098\nProperty Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the\n\n90\n00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:51.778\nvalue of any other property in the same database.\n\n91\n00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:54.198\nDivision Operator This just divides a number by another\n\n92\n00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:59.698\nnumber. You can also use the divide function, but the slash character is just so much more convenient.\n\n93\n00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:05.378\nHard-coded number. Hard-coded is my term for data that you write directly into a formula.\n\n94\n00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:11.518\nThe opposite of hard-coded data would be a property reference. String concatenation. This basically\n\n95\n00:07:11.518 --> 00:07:17.598\nmeans combining two strings together. For example, monkey D as one string and Luffy as another string\n\n96\n00:07:17.598 --> 00:07:22.598\nwould return monkey D Luffy if you concatenated them together. Now you can also use the concat\n\n97\n00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:27.178\nfunction for this, but again, the plus operator is just so much more easy to use and it's much\n\n98\n00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:31.578\nmore flexible as well. All right, let's move on. Don't worry if some of what we covered here feels\n\n99\n00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:36.698\nconfusing. The entire point of this lesson is to number one, give you a quick win in order to\n\n100\n00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:41.878\nmotivate you to push forward, but number two, give you some early exposure to several concepts that\n\n101\n00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:46.078\nwill be important later on. Remember those video games that give your character like all their\n\n102\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:51.038\nabilities and weapons and gear in the first level, only to then take it all away before you go into\n\n103\n00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:53.878\nSo the next one, this is a classic trick in game design.\n\n104\n00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:55.478\nIt gives you a taste of what's to come,\n\n105\n00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:57.778\nand it also makes each new ability and upgrade\n\n106\n00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:00.518\nfeel somewhat familiar when you finally unlock it\n\n107\n00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:01.478\nlater in the game.\n\n108\n00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:02.978\nAnd that small amount of familiarity\n\n109\n00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.458\ncan help you to build mastery much faster.\n\n110\n00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:07.598\nSo now that we've finished this initial challenge,\n\n111\n00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:09.938\nlet's move on to the proper course introduction.\n\n",

        "full_transcript": "Welcome to the Notion Formula Bootcamp. We are going to kick things immediately into high gear and create two useful Notion formulas in this lesson. And every lesson in this course has both a written version and a video version. So you can pick whichever you like. This audio narration is provided to pace you through the written version in case that's helpful to you, but you don't have to use it. Now, you're going to find a more traditional course intro in the next section, but I wanted to start things out here with giving you a quick win. Now, quick wins are crucial to long-term successful learning, in my opinion. By getting your hands really dirty and experiencing quick wins, you'll gain motivation and confidence to keep pushing you deeper into the learning curve. So, let's get started. Here's a page from my Notion Pokedex, and this entry is for Articuno, which happens to be my favorite Pokemon. And it's mostly complete. But there's just one problem. What's up with these height and weight values? A height of 17? A weight of 554? pretty sure a bird does not weigh that much. So what's going on here? Well, these height and weight values are pulled from PokeAPI, a resource that has data on every Pokemon in existence. And the data in PokeAPI is exactly the same as the data in the official Pokemon games. And for technical reasons, the Pokemon developers decided to store height values in decimeters and weight values in hectograms. And if you're US-based like me and you don't readily know what these terms mean, they're lesser known units in the metric system. Desi means a tenth, while hecto means 100. So a decimeter is one-tenth of a meter and a hectogram is 100 grams or one-tenth of a kilogram. So to make these values more readable, let's create two notion formulas, one to convert decimeters to meters and one to convert hectograms into kilograms. Let's go ahead and build the first one. Height, decimeters to meters. Now I've created a template version of my Pokedex that you can access and duplicate into your own workspace. Click that link, duplicate the template into your workspace, and then navigate to the Articuno page Next create a new property with the formula property type and call it height parentheses M parentheses If you need a refresher on creating database properties by the way you can find one in my Notion database guide In the formula editor enter the following formula and here's the formula in vocal form. Format parentheses, prompt parentheses, height parentheses, divided by 10 parentheses plus M. Like magic, you're going to see this formula return Articuno's height in meters, 1.7 meters. Congrats, you've just written your first Notion formula. Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at that really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation for Charmander as well. This is the beauty of the way that formulas and database properties interact. Across your database, the height M property is written the same. However, because your formula pulls information from other properties, in this case, height, the return value can be different for each database row. By the way, you've also just used six Notion formula principles, all in a single one-line formula. The format function, type conversion, a property reference, the division operator, a hard-coded number, and string concatenation. Now, don't worry if you don't know what any of these terms mean just yet. I'm going to explain them all in a minute. And by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them. For now, let's put your brain to work. I gave you the formula for height in meters. Now it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms. Challenge, create a weight kilograms formula. Using what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms. If you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno. Now challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch. I will give you two small hints to get started. First, the formula will be extremely similar to the one we just built for height and meters. And second, think about the unit conversion that we're trying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress I would urge you not to look at that answer until you've at least followed the 15-minute rule, which I have linked in this lesson. The best piece of advice I can give you for both completing this course and learning anything is to embrace the learning curve. View yourself as the kind of person who runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall when it confronts you. Breaking down the formula. As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas. These principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas. And fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road. They certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly. Now let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly. For each, I'm going to link to the relevant section in my Notion formula reference in case you want to dig deeper.

And these links are present for thoroughness as I am a detail-oriented nerd. But if you are intimidated by them, feel free to skip them for now. We are going to cover everything important throughout this course, and we're going to do it in an action-oriented manner. Now, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing. First, this formula is going to get the value of the height property. Now, height is a number type property. In Articuno's case, the value is 17. It then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7. And I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database. By contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is. The format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of this entire formula is 1.7m, or meters. Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned above come into play here. First, the format function. This is a function that accepts data of any type as its argument and converts that data to a string. Type Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers, dates, and boolean values . However, they can only return data of a single type. Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas. Property Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the value of any other property in the same database. Division Operator This just divides a number by another number.

It gives you a taste of what's to come, and it also makes each new ability and upgrade feel somewhat familiar when you finally unlock it later in the game. And that small amount of familiarity can help you to build mastery much faster. So now that we've finished this initial challenge, let's move on to the proper course introduction.",

Desi means a tenth,\n\n25\n00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.900\nwhile hecto means 100. So a decimeter is one-tenth of a meter and a hectogram is 100 grams or one-tenth\n\n26\n00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.500\nof a kilogram. So to make these values more readable, let's create two notion formulas,\n\n27\n00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.700\none to convert decimeters to meters and one to convert hectograms into kilograms. Let's go ahead\n\n28\n00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.800\nand build the first one. Height, decimeters to meters.

Congrats, you've just written your first Notion\n\n35\n00:02:29.006 --> 00:02:33.986\nformula. Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at\n\n36\n00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:37.426\nthat really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation\n\n37\n00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:43.446\nfor Charmander as well.

Now, don't worry if you\n\n43\n00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:17.366\ndon't know what any of these terms mean just yet. I'm going to explain them all in a minute.\n\n44\n00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:21.186\nAnd by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them.\n\n45\n00:03:21.686 --> 00:03:23.606\nFor now, let's put your brain to work.\n\n46\n00:03:23.886 --> 00:03:26.086\nI gave you the formula for height in meters.\n\n47\n00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.866\nNow it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms.\n\n48\n00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:33.765\nChallenge, create a weight kilograms formula.\n\n49\n00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:37.265\nUsing what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms.\n\n50\n00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:42.386\nIf you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno.\n\n51\n00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.646\nNow challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch.\n\n52\n00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:51.086\nI will give you two small hints to get started. First, the formula will be extremely similar to\n\n53\n00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:56.126\nthe one we just built for height and meters. And second, think about the unit conversion that we're\n\n54\n00:03:56.126 --> 00:04:10.532\ntrying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress\n\n55\n00:04:10.652 --> 00:04:12.312\nI would urge you not to look at that answer\n\n56\n00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:15.192\nuntil you've at least followed the 15-minute rule,\n\n57\n00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:17.091\nwhich I have linked in this lesson.\n\n58\n00:04:17.312 --> 00:04:19.052\nThe best piece of advice I can give you\n\n59\n00:04:19.052 --> 00:04:21.612\nfor both completing this course and learning anything\n\n60\n00:04:21.612 --> 00:04:23.772\nis to embrace the learning curve.\n\n61\n00:04:24.132 --> 00:04:26.012\nView yourself as the kind of person\n\n62\n00:04:26.012 --> 00:04:28.972\nwho runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall\n\n63\n00:04:28.972 --> 00:04:29.972\nwhen it confronts you.\n\n64\n00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:36.672\nBreaking down the formula. As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas.\n\n65\n00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:42.212\nThese principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas.\n\n66\n00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:47.732\nAnd fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road.\n\n67\n00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.112\nThey certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly.\n\n68\n00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:55.872\nNow let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly.\n\n69\n00:04:55.872 --> 00:05:00.812\nFor each, I'm going to link to the relevant section in my Notion formula reference in case you want to dig deeper.\n\n70\n00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:04.272\nAnd you're going to see me link to this formula reference a lot throughout this course.\n\n71\n00:05:04.612 --> 00:05:11.132\nThis is akin to the way that any JavaScript course worth its salt would at least tell you to go look at the MDN web docs.\n\n72\n00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.752\nThey are the definitive reference for the language.\n\n73\n00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:17.892\nAnd these links are present for thoroughness as I am a detail-oriented nerd.\n\n74\n00:05:18.312 --> 00:05:21.692\nBut if you are intimidated by them, feel free to skip them for now.\n\n75\n00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:26.592\nWe are going to cover everything important throughout this course, and we're going to do it in an action-oriented manner.\n\n76\n00:05:27.212 --> 00:05:31.072\nNow, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing.\n\n77\n00:05:31.492 --> 00:05:34.692\nFirst, this formula is going to get the value of the height property.\n\n78\n00:05:34.972 --> 00:05:38.752\nNow, height is a number type property. In Articuno's case, the value is 17.\n\n79\n00:05:39.412 --> 00:05:43.992\nIt then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7.\n\n80\n00:05:44.372 --> 00:05:50.992\nAnd I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database.\n\n81\n00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:56.832\nBy contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is.\n\n82\n00:05:57.132 --> 00:06:15.198\nThe format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of\n\n83\n00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:21.598\nthis entire formula is 1.7m, or meters. Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned\n\n84\n00:06:21.598 --> 00:06:26.598\nabove come into play here. First, the format function. This is a function that accepts data\n\n85\n00:06:26.598 --> 00:06:31.158\nof any type as its argument and converts that data to a string.\n\n86\n00:06:31.158 --> 00:06:34.578\nType Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers,\n\n87\n00:06:34.578 --> 00:06:40.478\ndates, and boolean values . However, they can only return data of a single\n\n88\n00:06:40.478 --> 00:06:45.438\ntype. Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas.\n\n89\n00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:48.098\nProperty Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the\n\n90\n00:06:48.098 --> 00:06:51.778\nvalue of any other property in the same database.\n\n91\n00:06:51.778 --> 00:06:54.198\nDivision Operator This just divides a number by another\n\n92\n00:06:54.198 --> 00:06:59.698\nnumber. You can also use the divide function, but the slash character is just so much more convenient.\n\n93\n00:07:00.518 --> 00:07:05.378\nHard-coded number. Hard-coded is my term for data that you write directly into a formula.\n\n94\n00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:11.518\nThe opposite of hard-coded data would be a property reference. String concatenation. This basically\n\n95\n00:07:11.518 --> 00:07:17.598\nmeans combining two strings together. For example, monkey D as one string and Luffy as another string\n\n96\n00:07:17.598 --> 00:07:22.598\nwould return monkey D Luffy if you concatenated them together. Now you can also use the concat\n\n97\n00:07:22.598 --> 00:07:27.178\nfunction for this, but again, the plus operator is just so much more easy to use and it's much\n\n98\n00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:31.578\nmore flexible as well. All right, let's move on. Don't worry if some of what we covered here feels\n\n99\n00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:36.698\nconfusing. The entire point of this lesson is to number one, give you a quick win in order to\n\n100\n00:07:36.698 --> 00:07:41.878\nmotivate you to push forward, but number two, give you some early exposure to several concepts that\n\n101\n00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:46.078\nwill be important later on. Remember those video games that give your character like all their\n\n102\n00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:51.038\nabilities and weapons and gear in the first level, only to then take it all away before you go into\n\n103\n00:07:51.038 --> 00:07:53.878\nSo the next one, this is a classic trick in game design.\n\n104\n00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:55.478\nIt gives you a taste of what's to come,\n\n105\n00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:57.778\nand it also makes each new ability and upgrade\n\n106\n00:07:57.778 --> 00:08:00.518\nfeel somewhat familiar when you finally unlock it\n\n107\n00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:01.478\nlater in the game.\n\n108\n00:08:01.478 --> 00:08:02.978\nAnd that small amount of familiarity\n\n109\n00:08:02.978 --> 00:08:05.458\ncan help you to build mastery much faster.\n\n110\n00:08:05.458 --> 00:08:07.598\nSo now that we've finished this initial challenge,\n\n111\n00:08:07.598 --> 00:08:09.938\nlet's move on to the proper course introduction.",

            "Welcome to the Notion Formula Bootcamp. We are going to kick things immediately into high gear and create two useful Notion formulas in this lesson. And every lesson in this course has both a written version and a video version. So you can pick whichever you like. This audio narration is provided to pace you through the written version in case that's helpful to you, but you don't have to use it. Now, you're going to find a more traditional course intro in the next section, but I wanted to start things out here with giving you a quick win. Now, quick wins are crucial to long-term successful learning, in my opinion. By getting your hands really dirty and experiencing quick wins, you'll gain motivation and confidence to keep pushing you deeper into the learning curve. So, let's get started. Here's a page from my Notion Pokedex, and this entry is for Articuno, which happens to be my favorite Pokemon. And it's mostly complete. But there's just one problem. What's up with these height and weight values? A height of 17? A weight of 554? pretty sure a bird does not weigh that much. So what's going on here? Well, these height and weight values are pulled from PokeAPI, a resource that has data on every Pokemon in existence. And the data in PokeAPI is exactly the same as the data in the official Pokemon games. And for technical reasons, the Pokemon developers decided to store height values in decimeters and weight values in hectograms. And if you're US-based like me and you don't readily know what these terms mean, they're lesser known units in the metric system. Desi means a tenth, while hecto means 100. So a decimeter is one-tenth of a meter and a hectogram is 100 grams or one-tenth of a kilogram. So to make these values more readable, let's create two notion formulas, one to convert decimeters to meters and one to convert hectograms into kilograms. Let's go ahead and build the first one. Height, decimeters to meters. Now I've created a template version of my Pokedex that you can access and duplicate into your own workspace. Click that link, duplicate the template into your workspace, and then navigate to the Articuno page Next create a new property with the formula property type and call it height parentheses M parentheses If you need a refresher on creating database properties by the way you can find one in my Notion database guide In the formula editor enter the following formula and here's the formula in vocal form. Format parentheses, prompt parentheses, height parentheses, divided by 10 parentheses plus M. Like magic, you're going to see this formula return Articuno's height in meters, 1.7 meters. Congrats, you've just written your first Notion formula. Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at that really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation for Charmander as well. This is the beauty of the way that formulas and database properties interact. Across your database, the height M property is written the same. However, because your formula pulls information from other properties, in this case, height, the return value can be different for each database row. By the way, you've also just used six Notion formula principles, all in a single one-line formula. The format function, type conversion, a property reference, the division operator, a hard-coded number, and string concatenation. Now, don't worry if you don't know what any of these terms mean just yet. I'm going to explain them all in a minute. And by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them. For now, let's put your brain to work. I gave you the formula for height in meters. Now it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms. Challenge, create a weight kilograms formula. Using what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms. If you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno. Now challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch. I will give you two small hints to get started. First, the formula will be extremely similar to the one we just built for height and meters. And second, think about the unit conversion that we're trying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress I would urge you not to look at that answer until you've at least followed the 15-minute rule, which I have linked in this lesson. The best piece of advice I can give you for both completing this course and learning anything is to embrace the learning curve. View yourself as the kind of person who runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall when it confronts you. Breaking down the formula. As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas. These principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas. And fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road. They certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly. Now let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly.

Now, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing. First, this formula is going to get the value of the height property. Now, height is a number type property. In Articuno's case, the value is 17. It then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7. And I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database. By contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is. The format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of this entire formula is 1.7m, or meters. Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned above come into play here. First, the format function. This is a function that accepts data of any type as its argument and converts that data to a string. Type Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers, dates, and boolean values . However, they can only return data of a single type. Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas. Property Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the value of any other property in the same database. Division Operator This just divides a number by another number.

Your copy of the Pokedex template also contains an entry for Charmander, so go look at that really quick and you're going to see that your formula is performing the correct calculation for Charmander as well. ",
                "This is the beauty of the way that formulas and database properties interact.  Across your database, the height M property is written the same.  However, because your formula pulls information from other properties, in this case, height, the return value can be different for each database row.  By the way, you've also just used six Notion formula principles, all in a single one-line formula. ",
                "The format function, type conversion, a property reference, the division operator, a hard-coded number, and string concatenation.  Now, don't worry if you don't know what any of these terms mean just yet.  I'm going to explain them all in a minute.  And by the end of this course, you're going to be very comfortable with all of them. ",
                "For now, let's put your brain to work.  I gave you the formula for height in meters.  Now it's your turn to build a similar formula for weight in kilograms.  Challenge, create a weight kilograms formula. ",
                "Using what you've learned, create the formula for weight in kilograms.  If you create it correctly, you should see a value of 55.4 kilograms for Articuno.  Now challenge yourself to write this formula from scratch.  I will give you two small hints to get started. ",
                "First, the formula will be extremely similar to the one we just built for height and meters.  And second, think about the unit conversion that we're trying to do A hectogram is 100 grams while a kilogram our target unit is 1000 grams Now if you really need the answer you can find it in the course answers page But for the sake of your learning progress I would urge you not to look at that answer until you've at least followed the 15-minute rule, which I have linked in this lesson.  The best piece of advice I can give you for both completing this course and learning anything is to embrace the learning curve.  View yourself as the kind of person who runs headfirst and bursts through the brick wall when it confronts you. ",
                "Breaking down the formula.  As I mentioned earlier, you just used six different formula principles while creating these two formulas.  These principles, among others, will be crucial to your foundational understanding of Notion formulas.  And fun fact, they will also help you learn to code better if you choose to do that someday down the road. ",
                "They certainly helped me understand JavaScript a lot more quickly.  Now let's break down our height and meters formula and go through each of these principles super quickly.  For each, I'm going to link to the relevant section in my Notion formula reference in case you want to dig deeper.  And you're going to see me link to this formula reference a lot throughout this course. ",
                "This is akin to the way that any JavaScript course worth its salt would at least tell you to go look at the MDN web docs.  They are the definitive reference for the language.  And these links are present for thoroughness as I am a detail-oriented nerd.  But if you are intimidated by them, feel free to skip them for now. ",
                "We are going to cover everything important throughout this course, and we're going to do it in an action-oriented manner.  Now, first, here's a plain English summary of what this formula is actually doing.  First, this formula is going to get the value of the height property.  Now, height is a number type property. ",
                "In Articuno's case, the value is 17.  It then divides this value by 10, returning a numeric value of 1.7.  And I'll note that 10 is a hard-coded value in the formula, so it will always be 10 across all rows in the database.  By contrast, our prop height function will be whatever the height value of each row is. ",
                "The format function then converts this numeric value into a string value and strings are essentially just pieces of text Finally the plus or addition operator is used to concatenate i combine the string value with another string in this case space and then m And the final return value of this entire formula is 1.7m, or meters.  Now, let's see how each of the six formula pieces I mentioned above come into play here.  First, the format function.  This is a function that accepts data of any type as its argument and converts that data to a string. ",
                "Type Conversion Notion formulas can work with strings, numbers, dates, and boolean values .  However, they can only return data of a single type.  Therefore, you often have to convert data types when writing your formulas.  Property Reference Using the prop function, we can bring in the value of any other property in the same database. ",
                "Division Operator This just divides a number by another number.  You can also use the divide function, but the slash character is just so much more convenient.  Hard-coded number.  Hard-coded is my term for data that you write directly into a formula. ",
                "The opposite of hard-coded data would be a property reference.  String concatenation.  This basically means combining two strings together.  For example, monkey D as one string and Luffy as another string would return monkey D Luffy if you concatenated them together. ",
                "Now you can also use the concat function for this, but again, the plus operator is just so much more easy to use and it's much more flexible as well.  All right, let's move on.  Don't worry if some of what we covered here feels confusing.  The entire point of this lesson is to number one, give you a quick win in order to motivate you to push forward, but number two, give you some early exposure to several concepts that will be important later on. ",
                "Remember those video games that give your character like all their abilities and weapons and gear in the first level, only to then take it all away before you go into So the next one, this is a classic trick in game design.  It gives you a taste of what's to come, and it also makes each new ability and upgrade feel somewhat familiar when you finally unlock it later in the game.  And that small amount of familiarity can help you to build mastery much faster.  So now that we've finished this initial challenge, let's move on to the proper course introduction."

                "Esta narración de audio se proporciona para ayudarte a avanzar a través de la versión escrita en caso de que sea útil para ti, pero no la necesitas usar.   A continuación, encontrarás una introducción tradicional al curso, pero quería empezar aquí con una victoria rápida.   Ahora, las victorias rápidas son cruciales para el aprendizaje a largo plazo, a mi parecer.   Al poner las manos realmente sucias y experimentar victorias rápidas, ganarás motivación y confianza para seguir empujándote más profundamente en la curva de aprendizaje. ",
                "Empecemos.  Aquí está una página de mi Pokedex de Notion y esta entrada es para Articuno, que sucede ser mi Pokémon favorito.   Y está casi completa.   Pero hay un problema solo. ",
                "¿Qué pasa con estos valores de altura y peso?   Una altura de 17?   Un peso de 554?   Seguro que un pájaro no pesa tanto. ",
                "Entonces, ¿qué está pasando aquí?   Bueno, estos valores de altura y peso se extraen de PokeAPI, una fuente de datos que tiene información sobre cada Pokémon en existencia.   Y los datos en PokeAPI son exactamente los mismos que los datos en los juegos oficiales de Pokémon.   Y por razones técnicas, los desarrolladores de Pokémon decidieron almacenar los valores de altura en decímetros y los valores de peso en hectogramos. ",
                "Y si eres de los Estados Unidos como yo y no conoces fácilmente estos términos, son unidades menos conocidas del sistema métrico.  Desi significa décima, mientras que hecto significa 100.   Así, un decímetro es una décima parte de un metro y un hectogramo es 100 gramos o una décima parte de un kilogramo.   Para hacer que estos valores sean más legibles, creemos dos fórmulas de Notion, una para convertir decímetros a metros y otra para convertir hectogramos a kilogramos. ",
                "Vamos a empezar a construir el primero.   Altura, decímetros a metros.   Ahora he creado una versión de plantilla de mi Pokedex que puedes acceder y duplicar en tu propio espacio de trabajo.   Haz clic en ese enlace, duplica la plantilla en tu espacio de trabajo y luego navega a la página de Articuno.  ",
                "Crea una nueva propiedad con el tipo de propiedad de fórmula y llámala altura (M) ( ).   Si necesitas un refresco sobre la creación de propiedades de base de datos, por cierto, puedes encontrar uno en mi guía de Notion de base de datos.   En el editor de fórmulas ingresa la siguiente fórmula y aquí está la fórmula en voz.  Formatea (paréntesis), pide (paréntesis), altura (paréntesis), dividido por 10 (paréntesis) más M.  ",
                "Como por arte de magia, vas a ver que esta fórmula devuelve la altura de Articuno en metros, 1,7 metros.   Felicidades, has escrito tu primera fórmula de Notion.   Tu copia del plantilla de Pokedex también contiene una entrada para Charmander, así que ve a mirarla rápidamente y vas a ver que tu fórmula está realizando el cálculo correcto para Charmander también.  Esta es la belleza de la forma en que las fórmulas y las propiedades de la base de datos interactúan.  ",
                "A lo largo de su base de datos, la propiedad de altura M se escribe de la misma manera.   Sin embargo, debido a que su fórmula extrae información de otras propiedades, en este caso, altura, el valor de retorno puede ser diferente para cada fila de la base de datos.   Por cierto, también ha utilizado seis principios de fórmulas de Notion, todos en una sola fórmula de una línea.  El formato de función, la conversión de tipo, una referencia a la propiedad, el operador de división, un número codificado a mano y la concatenación de cadenas.  ",
                "Ahora, no te preocupes si no sabes qué significan todavía.   Te explicaré todos en un minuto.   Y al final de este curso, estarás muy cómodo con todos ellos.  Peso en kilogramos = Peso en libras × 0,45359237 No text provided for translation. ",
                "Primero, la fórmula será extremadamente similar a la que acabamos de construir para la altura y los metros.   Y segundo, piensa en la conversión de unidades que estamos tratando de hacer.   Un hectogramo es 100 gramos mientras que un kilogramo, nuestra unidad objetivo es 1000 gramos.   Si realmente necesitas la respuesta, puedes encontrarla en la página de respuestas del curso.  ",
                "Pero por el bien de tu progreso de aprendizaje, te animo a no mirar esa respuesta hasta que hayas seguido al menos la regla de los 15 minutos, que he enlazado en esta lección.   El mejor consejo que puedo darte para ambos completar este curso y aprender cualquier cosa es abrazar la curva de aprendizaje.   Mírate como el tipo de persona que corre de cabeza y rompe la pared cuando se enfrenta a ella.  Desglosando la fórmula.  ",
                "Como mencioné anteriormente, utilizaste seis principios de fórmulas diferentes al crear estas dos fórmulas.   Estos principios, entre otros, serán fundamentales para tu comprensión básica de las fórmulas de Notion.   Y un hecho divertido, también te ayudarán a aprender a codificar mejor si decides hacerlo algún día en el futuro.  Seguramente me ayudaron a entender JavaScript mucho más rápido.  ",
                "Ahora, vamos a desglosar nuestra fórmula de altura y metros y pasaremos por cada uno de estos principios muy rápidamente.   Para cada uno, voy a enlazar a la sección relevante en mi referencia de fórmulas de Notion en caso de que quieras profundizar más.   Y vas a ver que enlazo a esta referencia de fórmulas mucho a lo largo de este curso.  Esto es similar a la forma en que cualquier curso de JavaScript digno de su sal sepan al menos decirte que vayas a mirar los MDN web docs.  ",
                "Son la referencia definitiva para el lenguaje.   Y estos enlaces están presentes por exhaustividad ya que soy un nerd detallista.   Pero si te sientes intimidado por ellos, no dudes en saltarte por ahora.  Vamos a cubrir todo lo importante a lo largo de este curso, y lo vamos a hacer de manera orientada a la acción.  ",
                "Ahora, primero, aquí hay una resumen en inglés claro de lo que esta fórmula está haciendo realmente.   Primero, esta fórmula va a obtener el valor de la propiedad de altura.   Ahora, la altura es una propiedad de tipo número.  En el caso de Articuno, el valor es 17. ",
                "Luego divide este valor por 10, devolviendo un valor numérico de 1,7.  Y notaré que 10 es un valor hard-codificado en la fórmula, por lo que siempre será 10 en todas las filas de la base de datos.  Por contraste, nuestra función de altura de proporción será lo que sea el valor de altura de cada fila.  La función format luego convierte este valor numérico en un valor de cadena y las cadenas son básicamente trozos de texto. ",
                "Finalmente, el operador de suma o suma se utiliza para concatenar i combina la cadena de valor con otra cadena en este caso espacio y luego m.  Y el valor de retorno final de toda esta fórmula es 1.7m, o metros.   Ahora, veamos cómo cada una de las seis piezas de fórmula que mencioné anteriormente entran en juego aquí.   Primero, la función format.  ",
                "Esta es una función que acepta datos de cualquier tipo como su argumento y convierte esos datos en una cadena.  La fórmula de Notion de conversión de tipos puede funcionar con cadenas, números, fechas y valores booleanos.   Sin embargo, solo pueden devolver datos de un solo tipo.   Por lo tanto, a menudo debes convertir tipos de datos cuando escribes tus fórmulas.  ",
                "Referencia de Propiedad  Usando la función prop, podemos traer el valor de cualquier otra propiedad en la misma base de datos.  Operador de División Esto solo divide un número por otro número.   También puedes usar la función dividir, pero el carácter de barra oblicua es mucho más conveniente.   Número hard-codificado.  ",
                "Hard-codificado es mi término para datos que escribas directamente en una fórmula.  La contraparte de los datos codificados en duro sería una referencia a una propiedad.   La concatenación de cadenas de caracteres.   Esto básicamente significa combinar dos cadenas de caracteres juntas.  ",
                "Por ejemplo, \"monkey D\" como una cadena y \"Luffy\" como otra cadena devolverían \"monkey D Luffy\" si se concatenaban entre sí.  Ahora puedes utilizar también la función concat para esto, pero de nuevo, el operador más es tan fácil de usar y es mucho más flexible también.   Vamos a seguir adelante.   No te preocupes si algunas de las cosas que cubrimos aquí te parecen confusas.  ",
                "El objetivo principal de esta lección es, número uno, darte un pequeño triunfo para motivarte a seguir adelante, pero número dos, darte una primera exposición a varios conceptos que serán importantes más adelante.  Recuerda a esos videojuegos que dan a tu personaje todas sus habilidades y armas y equipo en el primer nivel, solo para luego quitarles todo antes de que entres en el siguiente.   Esto es un truco clásico en el diseño de juegos.   Te da una idea de lo que está por venir, y también hace que cada nueva habilidad y mejora se sienta algo familiar cuando finalmente la desbloqueas más tarde en el juego.  ",
                "Y esa pequeña cantidad de familiaridad puede ayudarte a construir la maestría mucho más rápido.   Así que ahora que hemos terminado este desafío inicial, vamos a pasar a la introducción del curso adecuada."
