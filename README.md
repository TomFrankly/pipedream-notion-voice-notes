This workflow lets you create perfectly-transcribed and summarized notes from voice recordings.

It also can create useful lists from the transcript, including:

* Main points
* Action items
* Follow-up questions
* Potential rebuttals
* More!

To use it, simply set up and deploy the workflow in Pipedream using the one-click links in the section below, then upload mp3 or m4a files to your configured cloud storage folder.

### Upgrade Your Notion Experience

While this workflow will work with any Notion database, it's even better with a template.

For general productivity use, you'll love [Ultimate Brain](https://thomasjfrank.com/brain/) – my all-in-one second brain template for Notion. 

Ultimate Brain brings tasks, notes, projects, and goals all into one tool. Naturally, it works very well with this workflow.

**Are you a creator?** 

My [Creator's Companion](https://thomasjfrank.com/creators-companion/) template includes a ton of features that will help you make better-performing content and optimize your production process. There's even a version that includes Ultimate Brain, so you can easily use this workflow to create notes whenever you have an idea for a new video or piece of content.
